    "# In-class Project: Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "[Sentiment Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis) has been an important field of natural language processing. The core idea is to systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study affective states and subjective information. Sentiment analysis is widely applied to voice of the customer materials such as reviews and survey responses, online and social media, and recently to the financial market. In particular, couple of recent finance research has shown:\n",
    "1. The sentiment of consumers on social media has predictive power of the market condition in short time.\n",
    "2. The sentiment of company's filling documents (such as 10-K and 8-K) have predictive power on the company's performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways of doing sentiment analysis. One simple way to do sentiment analysis is:\n",
    "1. Prepare a list of positive and negative words.\n",
    "2. Count the number of occurences of positive and negative words in a document.\n",
    "3. Use the number of positive and negative words in the document to define its sentiment. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this HW, we will read in the positive and negative words defined by [Macdonald (2011)](http://www3.nd.edu/~mcdonald/Word_Lists.html). We will then read in Google and Facebook's 2016 10-K and define its sentiment based on the positive and negative words.\n",
