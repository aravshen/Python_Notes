item a
risk factors
please carefully consider the following risk factors if any of the following risks occur our business financial condition operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected in addition the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks
we face intense competition
our businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive and we have many competitors in different industries including retail ecommerce services digital content and electronic devices and web and infrastructure computing services some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources longer histories more customers andor greater brand recognition they may secure better terms from vendors adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to technology infrastructure fulfillment and marketing
competition may intensify as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business in addition new and enhanced technologies including search web and infrastructure computing services digital content and electronic devices may increase our competition the internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping and increased competition may reduce our sales and profits
our expansion places a significant strain on our management operational financial and other resources
we are rapidly and significantly expanding our global operations including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure to support our retail and services businesses this expansion increases the complexity of our business and places significant strain on our management personnel operations systems technical performance financial resources and internal financial control and reporting functions we may not be able to manage growth effectively which could damage our reputation limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results
our expansion into new products services technologies and geographic regions subjects us to additional business legal financial and competitive risks
we may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments and our customers may not adopt our new offerings these offerings may present new and difficult technology challenges and we may be subject to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues in addition profitability if any in our newer activities may be lower than in our older activities and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them if any of this were to occur it could damage our reputation limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results
we may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results and growth rate
we may not be able to accurately forecast our growth rate we base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates a significant portion of our expenses and investments is fixed and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected
our revenue growth may not be sustainable and our percentage growth rates may decrease our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our sellers and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide a softening of demand whether caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the us or global economies may result in decreased revenue or growth
our sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons including due to risks described elsewhere in this section and the following

our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers attract new customers and satisfy our customers demands

our ability to retain and expand our network of sellers

our ability to offer products on favorable terms manage inventory and fulfill orders

the introduction of competitive websites products services price decreases or improvements

changes in usage or adoption rates of the internet ecommerce electronic devices and web services including outside the us

timing effectiveness and costs of expansion and upgrades of our systems and infrastructure

the success of our geographic service and product line expansions


table of contents



the extent to which we finance and the terms of any such financing for our current operations and future growth

the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims which may include significant monetary damages or injunctive relief and could have a material adverse impact on our operating results

variations in the mix of products and services we sell

variations in our level of merchandise and vendor returns

the extent to which we offer free shipping continue to reduce prices worldwide and provide additional benefits to our customers

the extent to which we invest in technology and content fulfillment and other expense categories

increases in the prices of fuel and gasoline as well as increases in the prices of other energy products and commodities like paper and packing supplies

the extent to which our equitymethod investees record significant operating and nonoperating items

the extent to which operators of the networks between our customers and our websites successfully charge fees to grant our customers unimpaired and unconstrained access to our online services

our ability to collect amounts owed to us when they become due

the extent to which use of our services is affected by spyware viruses phishing and other spam emails denial of service attacks data theft computer intrusions outages and similar events and

terrorist attacks and armed hostilities
our international operations expose us to a number of risks
our international activities are significant to our revenues and profits and we plan to further expand internationally in certain international market segments we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any firsttomarket advantages or otherwise succeed it is costly to establish develop and maintain international operations and websites and promote our brand internationally our international operations may not be profitable on a sustained basis
in addition to risks described elsewhere in this section our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks including

local economic and political conditions

government regulation of ecommerce and other services electronic devices and competition and restrictive governmental actions such as trade protection measures including export duties and quotas and custom duties and tariffs nationalization and restrictions on foreign ownership

restrictions on sales or distribution of certain products or services and uncertainty regarding liability for products services and content including uncertainty as a result of less internetfriendly legal systems local laws lack of legal precedent and varying rules regulations and practices regarding the physical and digital distribution of media products and enforcement of intellectual property rights

business licensing or certification requirements such as for imports exports web services and electronic devices

limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions

limited fulfillment and technology infrastructure

shorter payable and longer receivable cycles and the resultant negative impact on cash flow

laws and regulations regarding consumer and data protection privacy network security encryption payments and restrictions on pricing or discounts

lower levels of use of the internet

lower levels of consumer spending and fewer opportunities for growth compared to the us

lower levels of credit card usage and increased payment risk

difficulty in staffing developing and managing foreign operations as a result of distance language and cultural differences

different employeeemployer relationships and the existence of works councils and labor unions

compliance with the us foreign corrupt practices act and other applicable us and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials and other third parties


table of contents



laws and policies of the us and other jurisdictions affecting trade foreign investment loans and taxes and

geopolitical events including war and terrorism
as international ecommerce and other online and web services grow competition will intensify local companies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of and focus on the local customer as well as their more established local brand names we may not be able to hire train retain and manage required personnel which may limit our international growth
the peoples republic of china prc and india regulate amazons and its affiliates businesses and operations in country through regulations and license requirements that may restrict i foreign investment in and operation of the internet it infrastructure data centers retail delivery and other sectors ii internet content and iii the sale of media and other products and services for example in order to meet local ownership and regulatory licensing requirements wwwamazoncn is operated by prc companies that are indirectly owned either wholly or partially by prc nationals in addition we provide certain technology services in china in conjunction with third parties that hold prc licenses to provide services in india the government restricts the ownership or control of indian companies by foreign entities involved in online multibrand retail trading activities for wwwamazonin we provide certain marketing tools and logistics services to third party sellers to enable them to sell online and deliver to customers and we hold an indirect minority interest in an entity that is a thirdparty seller on the wwwamazonin marketplace although we believe these structures and activities comply with existing laws they involve unique risks and the prc is actively considering changes in its foreign investment rules that could impact these structures and activities there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation of prc and indian laws and regulations and it is possible that these governments will ultimately take a view contrary to ours in addition our chinese and indian businesses and operations may be unable to continue to operate if we or our affiliates are unable to access sufficient funding or in china enforce contractual relationships with respect to management and control of such businesses if our international activities were found to be in violation of any existing or future prc indian or other laws or regulations or if interpretations of those laws and regulations were to change our businesses in those countries could be subject to fines and other financial penalties have licenses revoked or be forced to shut down entirely
if we do not successfully optimize and operate our fulfillment network and data centers our business could be harmed
if we do not adequately predict customer demand or otherwise optimize and operate our fulfillment network and data centers successfully it could result in excess or insufficient fulfillment or data center capacity or result in increased costs impairment charges or both or harm our business in other ways as we continue to add fulfillment and data center capability or add new businesses with different requirements our fulfillment and data center networks become increasingly complex and operating them becomes more challenging there can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our networks effectively
in addition a failure to optimize inventory in our fulfillment network will increase our net shipping cost by requiring longzone or partial shipments orders from several of our websites are fulfilled primarily from a single location and we have only a limited ability to reroute orders to third parties for dropshipping we and our cosourcers may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers if the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment services deliver product to our fulfillment centers in excess of forecasts we may be unable to secure sufficient storage space and may be unable to optimize our fulfillment network
we rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers if we are not able to negotiate acceptable terms with these companies or they experience performance problems or other difficulties it could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience in addition our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed orders to customers also may be negatively affected by inclement weather fire flood power loss earthquakes labor disputes acts of war or terrorism acts of god and similar factors
third parties either dropship or otherwise fulfill an increasing portion of our customers orders and we are increasingly reliant on the reliability quality and future procurement of their services under some of our commercial agreements we maintain the inventory of other companies thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory and operating our fulfillment network our failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability of these other companies to accurately forecast product demand would result in unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation


table of contents


the seasonality of our business places increased strain on our operations
we expect a disproportionate amount of our net sales to occur during our fourth quarter if we do not stock or restock popular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet customer demand it could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth if we overstock products we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or writeoffs and incur commitment costs which could reduce profitability we may experience an increase in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades splitshipments and additional longzone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season if too many customers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased holiday demand we may experience system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders which may reduce the volume of goods we sell and the attractiveness of our products and services in addition we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies and customer service cosourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand we also face risks described elsewhere in this item a relating to fulfillment network optimization and inventory
we generally have payment terms with our retail vendors that extend beyond the amount of time necessary to collect proceeds from our consumer customers as a result of holiday sales as of december  of each year our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances typically reach their highest level other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing activities this operating cycle results in a corresponding increase in accounts payable as of december  our accounts payable balance generally declines during the first three months of the year resulting in a corresponding decline in our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances
our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making integrating and maintaining commercial agreements strategic alliances and other business relationships
we provide ecommerce and other services to businesses through commercial agreements strategic alliances and business relationships under these agreements we provide web services technology fulfillment computing digital storage and other services as well as enable sellers to offer products or services through our websites these arrangements are complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity personnel and other resource commitments which may limit the amount of business we can service we may not be able to implement maintain and develop the components of these commercial relationships which may include web services fulfillment customer service inventory management tax collection payment processing hardware content and thirdparty software and engaging third parties to perform services the amount of compensation we receive under certain of our commercial agreements is partially dependent on the volume of the other companys sales therefore if the other companys offering is not successful the compensation we receive may be lower than expected or the agreement may be terminated moreover we may not be able to enter into additional commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms we also may be subject to claims from businesses to which we provide these services if we are unsuccessful in implementing maintaining or developing these services
as our agreements terminate we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms or at all we may in the future enter into amendments on less favorable terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us which could adversely affect our operating results
our present and future ecommerce services agreements other commercial agreements and strategic alliances create additional risks such as

disruption of our ongoing business including loss of management focus on existing businesses

impairment of other relationships

variability in revenue and income from entering into amending or terminating such agreements or relationships and

difficulty integrating under the commercial agreements
our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making integrating and maintaining acquisitions and investments
we have acquired and invested in a number of companies and we may acquire or invest in or enter into joint ventures with additional companies these transactions create risks such as

disruption of our ongoing business including loss of management focus on existing businesses

problems retaining key personnel

additional operating losses and expenses of the businesses we acquired or in which we invested

the potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets and goodwill including as a result of acquisitions


table of contents



the potential impairment of customer and other relationships of the company we acquired or in which we invested or our own customers as a result of any integration of operations

the difficulty of incorporating acquired technology and rights into our offerings and unanticipated expenses related to such integration

the difficulty of integrating a new companys accounting financial reporting management information and information security human resource and other administrative systems to permit effective management and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not implemented

for investments in which an investees financial performance is incorporated into our financial results either in full or in part the dependence on the investees accounting financial reporting and similar systems controls and processes

the difficulty of implementing at companies we acquire the controls procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company

potential unknown liabilities associated with a company we acquire or in which we invest and

for foreign transactions additional risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages and the economic political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries
as a result of future acquisitions or mergers we might need to issue additional equity securities spend our cash or incur debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to intangible assets any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business in addition valuations supporting our acquisitions and strategic investments could change rapidly given the current global economic climate we could determine that such valuations have experienced impairments or otherthantemporary declines in fair value which could adversely impact our financial results
we have foreign exchange risk
the results of operations of and certain of our intercompany balances associated with our international websites and product and service offerings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations upon translation operating results may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances as we have expanded our international operations our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased we also hold cash equivalents andor marketable securities in foreign currencies including british pounds chinese yuan euros and japanese yen if the us dollar strengthens compared to these currencies cash equivalents and marketable securities balances when translated may be materially less than expected and vice versa
the loss of key senior management personnel could negatively affect our business
we depend on our senior management and other key personnel particularly jeffrey p bezos our president ceo and chairman we do not have key person life insurance policies the loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees could harm our business
we could be harmed by data loss or other security breaches
as a result of our services being webbased and the fact that we process store and transmit large amounts of data including personal information for our customers failure to prevent or mitigate data loss or other security breaches including breaches of our vendors technology and systems could expose us or our customers to a risk of loss or misuse of such information adversely affect our operating results result in litigation or potential liability for us and otherwise harm our business we use third party technology and systems for a variety of reasons including without limitation encryption and authentication technology employee email content delivery to customers backoffice support and other functions some subsidiaries had past security breaches and although they did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss and other security breaches including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third party vendor such measures cannot provide absolute security
we face risks related to system interruption and lack of redundancy
we experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our websites and services unavailable or slow to respond and prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services if we are unable to continually add software and hardware effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure and take other steps to improve the efficiency of our systems it could cause system interruptions or delays and adversely affect our operating results


table of contents


our computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by fire flood power loss telecommunications failure earthquakes acts of war or terrorism acts of god computer viruses physical or electronic breakins and similar events or disruptions any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders and providing services which could make our product and service offerings less attractive and subject us to liability our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient in addition we may have inadequate insurance coverage to compensate for any related losses any of these events could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy
we face significant inventory risk
in addition to risks described elsewhere in this item a relating to fulfillment network and inventory optimization by us and third parties we are exposed to significant inventory risks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of seasonality new product launches rapid changes in product cycles and pricing defective merchandise changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products and other factors we endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products we manufacture andor sell demand for products however can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale in addition when we begin selling or manufacturing a new product it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships determine appropriate product or component selection and accurately forecast demand the acquisition of certain types of inventory or components may require significant leadtime and prepayment and they may not be returnable we carry a broad selection and significant inventory levels of certain products such as consumer electronics and we may be unable to sell products in sufficient quantities or during the relevant selling seasons any one of the inventory risk factors set forth above may adversely affect our operating results
we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties
we regard our trademarks service marks copyrights patents trade dress trade secrets proprietary technology and similar intellectual property as critical to our success and we rely on trademark copyright and patent law trade secret protection and confidentiality andor license agreements with our employees customers and others to protect our proprietary rights effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are made available we also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business furthermore regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to infringe upon or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights
we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights third parties that license our proprietary rights also may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation the protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources moreover the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights we also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights
other parties also may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights we have been subject to and expect to continue to be subject to claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the intellectual property rights of third parties such claims whether or not meritorious may result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources injunctions against us or the payment of damages including to satisfy indemnification obligations we may need to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights but such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all in addition we may not be able to obtain or utilize on terms that are favorable to us or at all licenses or other rights with respect to intellectual property we do not own these risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims
our digital content offerings depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content if the digital rights management technology that we use is compromised or otherwise malfunctions we could be subject to claims and content providers may be unwilling to include their content in our service
we have a rapidly evolving business model and our stock price is highly volatile
we have a rapidly evolving business model the trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response to among other risks the risks described elsewhere in this item a as well as

changes in interest rates

conditions or trends in the internet and the industry segments we operate in


table of contents



quarterly variations in operating results

fluctuations in the stock market in general and market prices for internetrelated companies in particular

changes in financial estimates by us or securities analysts and recommendations by securities analysts

changes in our capital structure including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public

changes in the valuation methodology of or performance by other ecommerce or technology companies and

transactions in our common stock by major investors and certain analyst reports news and speculation
volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash compensation to employees or grant larger stock awards than we have historically which could hurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders or both
government regulation is evolving and unfavorable changes could harm our business
we are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the internet ecommerce electronic devices and other services existing and future laws and regulations may impede our growth these regulations and laws may cover taxation privacy data protection pricing content copyrights distribution mobile communications electronic device certification electronic waste energy consumption environmental regulation electronic contracts and other communications competition consumer protection web services the provision of online payment services information reporting requirements unencumbered internet access to our services or access to our facilities the design and operation of websites the characteristics and quality of products and services and the commercial operation of unmanned aircraft systems it is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership libel and personal privacy apply to the internet ecommerce digital content and web services jurisdictions may regulate consumertoconsumer online businesses including certain aspects of our seller programs unfavorable regulations and laws could diminish the demand for our products and services and increase our cost of doing business
we could be subject to additional sales tax or other indirect tax liabilities
us supreme court decisions restrict the imposition of obligations to collect state and local sales taxes with respect to remote sales in the us however an increasing number of states and certain foreign jurisdictions have considered or adopted laws or administrative practices that attempt to impose obligations on remote sellers and online marketplaces to collect taxes on their behalf we support a federal law that would allow states to require sales tax collection by remote sellers under a nationwide system more than half of our revenue is already earned in jurisdictions where we collect sales tax or its equivalent a successful assertion by one or more states or foreign countries requiring us to collect taxes where we do not do so could result in substantial tax liabilities including for past sales as well as penalties and interest in addition if the tax authorities in jurisdictions where we already collect sales tax or other indirect taxes were successfully to challenge our positions our tax liability could increase substantially
we could be subject to additional income tax liabilities
we are subject to income taxes in the us federal and state and numerous foreign jurisdictions tax laws regulations and administrative practices in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change due to economic political and other conditions and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes there are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit changes in foreign currency exchange rates entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses acquisitions including integrations and investments changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation and changes in the relevant tax accounting and other laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals the us the european union and its member states and a number of other countries are actively pursuing changes in this regard
except as required under us tax laws we do not provide for us taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that have not been previously taxed since we intend to invest such undistributed earnings indefinitely outside of the us if our intent changes or if these funds are needed for our us operations we would be required to accrue or pay us taxes on some or all of these undistributed earnings and our effective tax rate would be adversely affected we are also currently subject to audit in various jurisdictions and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us developments in an audit litigation or the relevant laws regulations administrative practices principles and interpretations could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs

as well as for prior and subsequent periods for instance the irs is seeking to increase our us taxable income related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries for transactions undertaken in  and  and we are currently contesting the matter in us tax court in addition to the risk of additional tax for  and  transactions if this litigation is adversely determined or if the irs were to seek transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature for transactions in subsequent years we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities in addition in october  the european commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with european union rules on state aid if this matter is adversely resolved luxembourg may be required to assess and we may be required to pay additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and our taxes in the future could increase although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final outcome of tax audits investigations and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals
our supplier relationships subject us to a number of risks
we have significant suppliers including licensors and in some cases limited or singlesources of supply that are important to our sourcing services manufacturing and any related ongoing servicing of merchandise and content we do not have longterm arrangements with most of our suppliers to guarantee availability of merchandise content components or services particular payment terms or the extension of credit limits if our current suppliers were to stop selling or licensing merchandise content components or services to us on acceptable terms or delay delivery including as a result of one or more supplier bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions as a result of natural disasters or for other reasons we may be unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms or at all in addition if our suppliers or other vendors violate applicable laws regulations our code of standards and responsibilities or implement practices regarded as unethical unsafe or hazardous to the environment it could damage our reputation limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results
we may be subject to risks related to government contracts and related procurement regulations
our contracts with us as well as state local and foreign government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation administration and performance we may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including termination of contract refunding or suspending of payments forfeiture of profits payment of fines and suspension or debarment from future government business in addition such contracts may provide for termination by the government at any time without cause

some of the products we sell or manufacture may expose us to product liability claims relating to personal injury death or environmental or property damage and may require product recalls or other actions certain third parties also sell products using our ecommerce platform that may increase our exposure to product liability claims such as if these sellers do not have sufficient protection from such claims although we maintain liability insurance we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all in addition some of our agreements with our vendors and sellers do not indemnify us from product liability
we are subject to paymentsrelated risks
we accept payments using a variety of methods including credit card debit card credit accounts including promotional financing gift cards direct debit from a customers bank account consumer invoicing physical bank check and payment upon delivery for existing and future payment options we offer to our customers we may become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes that could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments products as well as fraud for certain payment methods including credit and debit cards we pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability we rely on third parties to provide certain amazonbranded payment methods and payment processing services including the processing of credit cards debit cards electronic checks and promotional financing in each case it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us we also offer cobranded credit card programs which could adversely affect our operating results if terminated we are also subject to payment card association operating rules including data security rules certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply if we fail to comply with these rules or requirements or if our data security systems are breached or compromised we may be liable for card issuing banks costs subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers process electronic funds transfers or facilitate other types of online payments and our business and operating

we could be liable for fraudulent or unlawful activities of sellers
the law relating to the liability of providers of online payment services is currently unsettled in addition governmental agencies could require changes in the way this business is conducted under our seller programs we may be unable to prevent sellers from collecting payments fraudulently or otherwise when buyers never receive the products they ordered or when the products received are materially different from the sellers descriptions under our az guarantee we reimburse buyers for payments up to certain limits in these situations and as our marketplace seller sales grow the cost of this program will increase and could negatively affect our operating results we also may be unable to prevent sellers on our sites or through other seller sites from selling unlawful goods selling goods in an unlawful manner or violating the proprietary rights of others and could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities by our sellers

forwardlooking statements
this annual report on form k includes forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  all statements other than statements of historical fact including statements regarding guidance industry prospects or future results of operations or financial position made in this annual report on form k are forwardlooking we use words such as anticipates believes expects future intends and similar expressions to identify forwardlooking statements forwardlooking statements reflect managements current expectations and are inherently uncertain actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons including among others fluctuations in foreign exchange rates changes in global economic conditions and customer spending world events the rate of growth of the internet and online commerce the amount that amazoncom invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments the mix of products sold to customers the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services the extent to which we owe income taxes competition management of growth potential fluctuations in operating results international growth and expansion the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims fulfillment sortation delivery and data center optimization risks of inventory management seasonality the degree to which we enter into maintain and develop commercial agreements acquisitions and strategic transactions payments risks and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity in addition the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks these risks and uncertainties as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from managements expectations are described in greater detail in item a of part i risk factors
overview
our primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers the products offered on our consumerfacing websites primarily include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale from vendors and those offered by thirdparty sellers and we also manufacture and sell electronic devices generally we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by thirdparty sellers as service sales we also offer other services such as compute storage and database offerings fulfillment publishing digital content subscriptions advertising and cobranded credit cards
our financial focus is on longterm sustainable growth in free cash flows per share free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital and cash capital expenditures including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs partially offset by investments we make in longerterm strategic initiatives to increase sales of products and services we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience including lowering prices improving availability offering faster delivery and performance times increasing selection increasing product categories and service offerings expanding product information improving ease of use improving reliability and earning customer trust we also seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes such as financings acquisitions and aligning employee compensation with shareholders interests we utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe this compensation model aligns the longterm interests of our shareholders and employees in measuring shareholder dilution we include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding without regard to estimated forfeitures total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were  million and  million as of december   and 
we seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs our variable costs include product and content costs payment processing and related transaction costs picking packaging and preparing orders for shipment transportation customer service support costs necessary to run aws and a portion of our marketing costs our fixed costs include the costs necessary to run our technology infrastructure to build enhance and add features to our websites and web services our electronic devices and digital offerings and to build and optimize our fulfillment centers variable costs generally change directly with sales volume while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs geographic expansion category expansion and other factors to decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers we seek to increase our direct sourcing increase discounts from suppliers and reduce defects in our processes to minimize growth in fixed costs we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture

because of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cashgenerating operating cycle on average our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due inventory turnover was  for  and  for  and  we expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by several factors including our product mix the mix of sales by us and by thirdparty sellers our continuing focus on instock inventory availability and selection of product offerings our investment in new geographies and product lines and the extent to which we choose to utilize thirdparty fulfillment providers accounts payable days were   and  for   and  we expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors including the mix of product sales the mix of sales by thirdparty sellers the mix of suppliers seasonality and changes in payment terms over time including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers
we expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists designers software and hardware engineers and merchandising employees our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the crossfunctionality of our systems and operations we seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and content including aws and expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies we believe that advances in technology specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power and the advances of wireless connectivity will continue to improve the consumer experience on the internet and increase its ubiquity in peoples lives to best take advantage of these continued advances in technology we are investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices we are also investing in aws which offers a broad set of global compute storage database and other service offerings to developers and enterprises of all sizes
our financial reporting currency is the us dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends for example if the us dollar weakens yearoveryear relative to currencies in our international locations our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant likewise if the us dollar strengthens yearoveryear relative to currencies in our international locations our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant we believe that our increasing diversification beyond the us economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the longterm we also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes
in addition the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and charges associated with the effect of movements in foreign currency exchange rates currency volatilities may continue which may significantly impact either positively or negatively our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons

critical accounting judgments
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the united states gaap requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes the sec has defined a companys critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and results of operations and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below we also have other key accounting policies which involve the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results for additional information see item  of part ii financial statements and supplementary datanote description of business and accounting policies although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based upon information presently available actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions

 


the operating cycle is the number of days of sales in inventory plus the number of days of sales in accounts receivable minus accounts payable days

inventory turnover is the quotient of trailing twelve month cost of sales to average inventory over five quarter ends

accounts payable days calculated as the quotient of accounts payable to current quarter cost of sales multiplied by the number of days in the current quarter


table of contents


inventories
inventories consisting of products available for sale are primarily accounted for using the firstin firstout fifo method and are valued at the lower of cost or market value this valuation requires us to make judgments based on currentlyavailable information about the likely method of disposition such as through sales to individual customers returns to product vendors or liquidations and expected recoverable values of each disposition category these assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material writedowns in the future as a measure of sensitivity for every  of additional inventory valuation allowance as of december   we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately  million
in addition we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components these commitments are based on forecasted customer demand if we reduce these commitments we may incur additional costs
goodwill
we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable during the second quarter of  we changed the measurement date of our annual goodwill impairment test from october  to april  in testing for goodwill impairment we may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if our qualitative assessment indicates that goodwill impairment is more likely than not we perform a twostep impairment test we test goodwill for impairment under the twostep impairment test by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units if the fair value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value we estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses based primarily on expected category expansion pricing market segment share and general economic conditions certain estimates of discounted cash flows involve businesses and geographies with limited financial history and developing revenue models changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded if any
during the year management monitored the actual performance of the business relative to the fair value assumptions used during our annual goodwill impairment test for the periods presented no triggering events were identified that required an interim impairment test as a measure of sensitivity a  decrease in the fair value of any of our reporting units as of april   would have had no impact on the carrying value of our goodwill
financial and credit market volatility directly impacts the fair value measurement through our weightedaverage cost of capital that we use to determine a discount rate and through our stock price that we use to determine our market capitalization during times of volatility significant judgment must be applied to determine whether credit or stock price changes are shortterm in nature or a longerterm trend we have not made any significant changes to the accounting methodology used to evaluate goodwill for impairment changes in our estimated future cash flows and asset fair values may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future as a measure of sensitivity a prolonged  decrease from our december   closing stock price would not be an indicator of possible impairment
stockbased compensation
we measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize it as compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest the fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock and the fair value of stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a blackscholes model the estimated number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures including employee level economic conditions time remaining to vest and historical forfeiture experience we update our estimated forfeiture rate quarterly we have not made any significant changes to the accounting methodology used to evaluate stockbased compensation changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material changes in stockbased compensation expense in the future as a measure of sensitivity a  change to our estimated forfeiture rate would have had an approximately  million impact on our  operating income our estimated forfeiture rates as of december   and  were  and 
we utilize the accelerated method rather than the straightline method for recognizing compensation expense for example over  of the compensation cost related to an award vesting ratably over four years is expensed in the first year if forfeited early in the life of an award the compensation expense adjustment is much greater under an accelerated method than under a straightline method

cash provided by used in financing activities was  billion  billion and  million in   and  cash outflows from financing activities result from principal repayments on obligations related to capital leases and finance leases and repayments of longterm debt and other principal repayments on obligations related to capital leases and finance leases and repayments of longterm debt and other were  billion  billion and  billion in   and  the increase in  primarily reflects additional repayments on capital leases as well as a  million repayment on our unsecured senior notes property and equipment acquired under capital leases were  billion  billion and  billion in   and  with the increases reflecting additional investments in support of continued business growth primarily due to investments in technology infrastructure for aws we expect this trend toward additional investment to continue over time cash inflows from financing activities primarily result from proceeds from longterm debt and other and tax benefits relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions proceeds from longterm debt and other were  million  billion and  million in   and  during  cash inflows from financing activities consisted primarily of net proceeds from the issuance of  billion of senior nonconvertible unsecured debt in five tranches maturing in  through  see item  of part ii financial statements and supplementary datanote longterm debt for additional discussion of the notes tax benefits relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions are presented as financing cash flows cash inflows from tax benefits related to stockbased compensation deductions were  million  million and  million in   and

our liquidity is also affected by restricted cash balances that are pledged as collateral for standby and trade letters of credit guarantees debt and real estate leases to the extent we process payments for thirdparty sellers or offer certain types of stored value to our customers some jurisdictions may restrict our use of those funds these restrictions would result in the reclassification of a portion of our cash and cash equivalents from cash and cash equivalents to restricted cash which is classified within accounts receivable net and other on our consolidated balance sheets as of december   and  restricted cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were  million and  million see item  of part ii financial statements and supplementary datanote commitments and contingencies for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments as well as our pledged assets purchase obligations and open purchase orders consisting of inventory and significant noninventory commitments were  billion as of december   purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions

we believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as well as borrowing available under our credit agreements will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next  months however any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty see item a of part i risk factors we continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities obtain credit facilities obtain capital finance and operating lease arrangements repurchase common stock pay dividends or repurchase refinance or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders in addition we will from time to time consider the acquisition of or investment in complementary businesses products services capital infrastructure and technologies which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to secure additional financing or issue additional equity or debt securities there can be no assurance that additional linesofcredit or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us if at all

operating expenses without stockbased compensation are nongaap financial measures see nongaap financial measures and item  of part ii financial statements and supplementary datanote description of business and accounting policiesstockbased compensation
in  we recorded charges estimated at  million primarily related to fire phone inventory valuation and supplier commitment costs the majority of which was included in the north america segment
cost of sales
cost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products digital media content costs where we record revenue gross including prime video and prime music packaging supplies sortation and delivery centers and related equipment costs and inbound and outbound shipping costs including where we are the transportation service provider shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers
the increase in cost of sales in absolute dollars in   and  compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to increased product and shipping costs resulting from increased sales the increase in  was also impacted by the expansion of digital offerings and fire phone inventory valuation and supplier commitment costs
costs to operate our aws segment are primarily classified as technology and content as we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports both our internal technology requirements and external sales to aws customers
fulfillment
fulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our north america and international fulfillment and customer service centers and payment processing costs while aws payment processing and related transaction costs are included in fulfillment aws costs are primarily classified as technology and content fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors such as payment processing and related transaction costs our level of productivity and accuracy changes in volume size and weight of units received and fulfilled timing of fulfillment capacity expansion the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties mix of products and services sold and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer selfservice features additionally because payment processing and fulfillment costs associated with seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions and payment processing and related transaction


table of contents


and fulfillment costs are higher as a percentage of sales versus our retail sales sales by our sellers have higher fulfillment costs as a percent of net sales
the increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in   and  compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to variable costs corresponding with increased physical and digital product and service sales volume inventory levels and sales mix costs from expanding fulfillment capacity and payment processing and related transaction costs
we seek to expand our fulfillment capacity to accommodate a greater selection and instock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services we regularly evaluate our facility requirements
marketing
we direct customers to our websites primarily through a number of targeted online marketing channels such as our associates program sponsored search portal advertising email marketing campaigns direct sales and other initiatives our marketing expenses are largely variable based on growth in sales and changes in rates to the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing expense
the increase in marketing costs in absolute dollars in   and  compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to increased spending on online marketing channels as well as payroll and related expenses
while costs associated with amazon prime memberships and other shipping offers are not included in marketing expense we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools and intend to continue offering them indefinitely
technology and content
technology costs consist principally of research and development activities including payroll and related expenses for employees involved in application production maintenance operation and platform development for new and existing products and services as well as aws and other technology infrastructure expenses content costs consist principally of payroll and related expenses for employees involved in category expansion editorial content buying and merchandising selection digital media content costs related to revenue recorded gross including prime video are included in cost of sales
we seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and content so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency through rapid technology developments while operating at an ever increasing scale our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the crossfunctionality of our systems and operations we expect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure the increase in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in   and  compared to comparable prior year periods is primarily due to increased spending on technology infrastructure principally allocated to our aws segment and an increase in payroll and related costs associated with expanding our products and services
technology infrastructure costs consist of servers networking equipment and data center related depreciation rent utilities and payroll expenses these costs are allocated to segments based on usage in   and  we expanded our technology infrastructure principally by increasing our capacity for aws service offerings globally compared to the comparable prior year periods additionally the costs associated with operating and maintaining our expanded infrastructure have increased over time corresponding with increased usage we expect these trends to continue over time as we invest in technology infrastructure to support increased usage
the increase in payroll and related costs is primarily due to the expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings including aws and initiatives to expand our ecosystem of products and services
for   and  we capitalized  million including  million of stockbased compensation  million including  million of stockbased compensation and  million including  million of stockbased compensation of costs associated with internaluse software and website development amortization of previously capitalized amounts was  million  million and  million for   and

the increase in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in  compared to the comparable prior year period is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses the increase in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in  compared to the comparable prior year period is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses and professional service fees


table of contents


stockbased compensation
stockbased compensation was  billion  billion and  billion during   and  the increase in   and  compared to the comparable prior year periods is primarily due to an increase in the number of stockbased compensation awards granted to existing and new employees
other operating expense income net
other operating expense income net was  million  million and  million during   and  and was primarily related to the amortization of intangible assets
income from operations
for the reasons discussed above income from operations increased to  billion in  from  million in  and  million in 
we believe that income from operations is a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services
interest income and expense
our interest income was  million  million and  million during   and  we generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short to intermediateterm fixed income securities and aaarated money market funds our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the prevailing rates which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested

our longterm debt was  billion and  billion as of december   and  our other longterm liabilities were  billion and  billion as of december   and  see item  of part ii financial statements and supplementary datanote longterm debt and note other longterm liabilities for additional information
other income expense net
other income expense net was  million  million and  million during   and  the primary component of other income expense net is related to foreigncurrency gains losses
income taxes
our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors including variability in our pretax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate changes in how we do business acquisitions including integrations and investments auditrelated developments foreign currency gains losses changes in law regulations and administrative practices and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized additionally our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pretax income or loss for example the impact of discrete items and nondeductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pretax income is lower
we recorded a provision for income taxes of  million  million and  million in   and  our provision for income taxes in  was higher than in  primarily due to an increase in us pretax income and increased losses in certain foreign subsidiaries for which we may not realize a tax benefit losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit primarily due to losses of foreign subsidiaries reduce our pretax income without a corresponding reduction in our tax expense and therefore increase our effective tax rate we have recorded valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets associated with losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit we generated income in lower tax jurisdictions primarily related to our european operations which are headquartered in luxembourg
our provision for income taxes in  was higher than in  primarily due to the increased losses in certain foreign subsidiaries for which we may not realize a tax benefit and auditrelated developments partially offset by the favorable impact of earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit were primarily generated by our foreign subsidiaries income earned in lower tax jurisdictions was primarily related to our european operations
we have tax benefits relating to excess stockbased compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our us taxable income in december  us legislation was enacted that extended accelerated depreciation deductions on qualifying property through  and made permanent the us federal research and development credit as of december   our federal net operating loss carryforward was approximately  billion and we had

all of these free cash flows measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures for example these measures of free cash flows do not incorporate the portion of payments representing principal reductions of debt or cash payments for business acquisitions additionally our mix of property and equipment acquisitions with cash or other financing options may change over time therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flows measures only as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows
operating expenses excluding stockbased compensation
operating expenses with and without stockbased compensation is provided to show the impact of stockbased compensation which is noncash and excluded from our internal operating plans and measurement of financial performance although we consider the dilutive impact to our shareholders when awarding stockbased compensation and value such awards accordingly in addition unlike other centrallyincurred operating costs stockbased compensation is not allocated to segment

results and therefore excluding it from operating expenses is consistent with our segment presentation in our footnotes to the consolidated financial statements
operating expenses without stockbased compensation has limitations since it does not include all expenses primarily related to our workforce more specifically if we did not pay out a portion of our compensation in the form of stockbased compensation our cash salary expense included in the fulfillment marketing technology and content and general and administrative line items would be higher
effect of foreign exchange rates
information regarding the effect of foreign exchange rates versus the us dollar on our consolidated statements of operations is provided to show reported period operating results had the foreign exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period

first quarter  guidance

net sales are expected to be between  billion and  billion or to grow between  and  compared with first quarter 

operating income is expected to be between  million and  million compared with  million in first quarter 

this guidance includes approximately  million for stockbased compensation and other operating expense income net it assumes among other things that no additional business acquisitions investments restructurings or legal settlements are concluded and that there are no further revisions to stockbased compensation estimates

description of business
amazoncom opened its virtual doors on the world wide web in july  we seek to be earths most customercentric company in each of our segments we serve our primary customer sets consisting of consumers sellers developers enterprises and content creators we serve consumers through our retail websites and focus on selection price and convenience we also manufacture and sell electronic devices we offer programs that enable sellers to sell their products on our websites and their own branded websites and to fulfill orders through us and programs that allow authors musicians filmmakers app developers and others to publish and sell content we serve developers and enterprises of all sizes through our aws segment which provides access to technology infrastructure that enables virtually any type of business in addition we provide services such as advertising services and cobranded credit card agreements
we have organized our operations into three segments north america international and aws see note segment information
prior period reclassifications
certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation including recasting the segment financial information within note segment information as a result of changing our reportable segments to include an aws segment
principles of consolidation
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of amazoncom inc its whollyowned subsidiaries and those entities in which we have a variable interest and of which we are the primary beneficiary including certain entities in india and china collectively the company intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities are eliminated
use of estimates
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes estimates are used for but not limited to determining the selling price of products and services in multiple element revenue arrangements and determining the amortization period of these elements incentive discount offers sales returns vendor funding stockbased compensation forfeiture rates income taxes valuation and impairment of investments inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments collectability of receivables valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill depreciable lives of property and equipment internaluse software and website development costs acquisition purchase price allocations investments in equity interests and contingencies actual results could differ materially from those estimates
earnings per share
basic earnings per share is calculated using our weightedaverage outstanding common shares diluted earnings per share is calculated using our weightedaverage outstanding common shares including the dilutive effect of stock awards as determined under the treasury stock method in periods when we have a net loss stock awards are excluded from our calculation of earnings per share as their inclusion would have an antidilutive effect in  we excluded stock awards of  million

revenue
we recognize revenue from product sales or services rendered when the following four criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or service has been rendered the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units and revenue is allocated using estimated selling prices if we do not have vendorspecific objective evidence or thirdparty evidence of the selling prices of the deliverables we allocate the arrangement price to each of the elements based on the relative selling prices of each element estimated selling prices are managements best estimates of the prices that we would charge our customers if we were to sell the standalone elements separately and include considerations of customer demand prices charged by us and others for similar deliverables and the price if largely based on the cost of producing the product or service
sales of our digital devices including kindle ereaders fire tablets fire tvs and echo are considered arrangements with multiple deliverables consisting of the device undelivered software upgrades andor undelivered nonsoftware services such as cloud storage and free trial memberships to other services the revenue allocated to the device which is the substantial portion of the total sale price and related costs are generally recognized upon delivery revenue related to undelivered software upgrades andor undelivered nonsoftware services is deferred and recognized generally on a straightline basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and nonsoftware services are expected to be provided for each of these devices
sales of amazon prime memberships are also considered arrangements with multiple deliverables including shipping benefits prime video prime music prime photos and access to the kindle owners lending library the revenue related to the deliverables is amortized over the life of the membership based on the estimated delivery of services amazon prime membership fees are allocated between product sales and service sales costs to deliver amazon prime benefits are recognized as cost of sales as incurred as we add more benefits to the prime membership we will update the method of determining the estimated selling prices of each element as well as the allocation of prime membership fees
we evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions generally when we are primarily obligated in a transaction are subject to inventory risk have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers or have several but not all of these indicators revenue is recorded at the gross sale price we generally record the net amounts as commissions earned if we are not primarily obligated and do not have latitude in establishing prices such amounts earned are determined using fixed fees a percentage of seller revenues perunit activity fees or some combination thereof
product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media content where we record revenue gross product sales and shipping revenues net of promotional discounts rebates and return allowances are recorded when the products are shipped and title passes to customers retail sales to customers are made pursuant to a sales contract that provides for transfer of both title and risk of loss upon our delivery to the carrier amazons electronic devices sold through retailers are recognized at the point of sale to consumers
service sales represent thirdparty seller fees earned including commissions and related shipping fees aws sales digital content subscriptions advertising services and our cobranded credit card agreements service sales net of promotional discounts and return allowances are recognized when service has been rendered
return allowances which reduce revenue are estimated using historical experience allowance for returns was  million  million and  million as of december    and  additions to the allowance were  billion  billion and  million and deductions to the allowance were  billion  billion and  million in   and  revenue from product sales and services rendered is recorded net of sales and consumption taxes additionally we periodically provide incentive offers to our customers to encourage purchases such offers include current discount offers such as percentage discounts off current purchases inducement offers such as offers for future discounts subject to a minimum current purchase and other similar offers current discount offers when accepted by our customers are treated as a reduction to the purchase price of the related transaction while inducement offers when accepted by our customers are treated as a reduction to purchase price based on estimated future redemption rates redemption rates are estimated using our historical experience for similar inducement offers current discount offers and inducement offers are presented as a net amount in total net sales
cost of sales
cost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products digital media content costs where we record revenue gross including prime video and prime music packaging supplies sortation and delivery centers and related equipment costs and inbound and outbound shipping costs including where we are the transportation service provider shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers payment processing and related transaction costs including those associated with seller transactions are classified in fulfillment on our consolidated statements of operations


table of contents


vendor agreements
we have agreements with our vendors to receive funds for advertising services cooperative marketing efforts promotions and volume rebates we generally consider amounts received from vendors to be a reduction of the prices we pay for their goods including property and equipment or services and therefore record those amounts as a reduction of the cost of inventory cost of services or cost of property and equipment vendor rebates are typically dependent upon reaching minimum purchase thresholds we evaluate the likelihood of reaching purchase thresholds using past experience and current year forecasts when volume rebates can be reasonably estimated we record a portion of the rebate as we make progress towards the purchase threshold
when we receive direct reimbursements for costs incurred by us in advertising the vendors product or service the amount we receive is recorded as an offset to marketing on our consolidated statements of operations
fulfillment
fulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our north america and international segments fulfillment and customer service centers including costs attributable to buying receiving inspecting and warehousing inventories picking packaging and preparing customer orders for shipment payment processing and related transaction costs including costs associated with our guarantee for certain seller transactions responding to inquiries from customers and supply chain management for our manufactured electronic devices fulfillment costs also include amounts paid to third parties that assist us in fulfillment and customer service operations
marketing
marketing costs primarily consist of targeted online advertising television advertising public relations expenditures and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities we pay commissions to participants in our associates program when their customer referrals result in product sales and classify such costs as marketing on our consolidated statements of operations we also participate in cooperative advertising arrangements with certain of our vendors and other third parties
advertising and other promotional costs are expensed as incurred and were  billion  billion and  billion in   and  prepaid advertising costs were not significant as of december   and 
technology and content
technology costs consist principally of research and development activities including payroll and related expenses for employees involved in application production maintenance operation and platform development for new and existing products and services as well as aws and other technology infrastructure expenses
content costs consist principally of payroll and related expenses for employees involved in category expansion editorial content buying and merchandising selection
technology and content costs are expensed as incurred except for certain costs relating to the development of internaluse software and website development including software used to upgrade and enhance our websites and applications supporting our business which are capitalized and amortized over two years
general and administrative
general and administrative expenses primarily consist of payroll and related expenses facilities and equipment such as depreciation expense and rent professional fees and litigation costs and other general corporate costs for corporate functions including accounting finance tax legal and human resources among others
stockbased compensation
compensation cost for all stock awards expected to vest is measured at fair value on the date of grant and recognized over the service period the fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock and the fair value of stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a blackscholes model such value is recognized as expense over the service period net of estimated forfeitures using the accelerated method the estimated number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures including employee level economic conditions time remaining to vest and historical forfeiture experience

other operating expense income net
other operating expense income net consists primarily of marketingrelated contractbased and customerrelated intangible asset amortization expense and expenses related to legal settlements
other income expense net
other income expense net consists primarily of foreign currency losses of  million  million and  million in   and  and realized gains losses on marketable securities sales of  million  million and  million in   and 
income taxes
income tax expense includes us federal and state and foreign income taxes except as required under us tax laws we do not provide for us taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that have not been previously taxed since we intend to invest such undistributed earnings indefinitely outside of the us if our intent changes or if these funds are needed for our us operations we would be required to accrue or pay us taxes on some or all of these undistributed earnings and our effective tax rate would be adversely affected undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely invested outside of the us were  billion as of december   determination of the unrecognized deferred tax liability that would be incurred if such amounts were repatriated is not practicable
deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered
deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe they will not be realized we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets including our recent cumulative earnings experience and expectations of future taxable income and capital gains by taxing jurisdiction the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes and other relevant factors we allocate our valuation allowance to current and longterm deferred tax assets on a prorata basis
we utilize a twostep approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain income tax positions tax contingencies the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than  likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement we consider many factors when evaluating our tax positions and estimating our tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes we include interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies in income tax expense
fair value of financial instruments
fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date to increase the comparability of fair value measures the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value
level valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets
level valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in level  such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data
level valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants these valuations require significant judgment
for our cash cash equivalents or marketable securities we measure the fair value of money market funds and equity securities based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities all other financial instruments were valued either based on recent trades of securities in inactive markets or based on quoted market prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data we did not hold any cash cash equivalents or marketable securities categorized as level  assets as of december   or december  
as part of entering into commercial agreements we often obtain equity warrant assets giving us the right to acquire stock primarily in private companies we record these assets in other assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets equity warrant assets are classified as level  assets and the balances and related activity for our equity warrant assets were not significant for the periods ended december    and 


table of contents


cash and cash equivalents
we classify all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents
inventories
inventories consisting of products available for sale are primarily accounted for using the firstin firstout fifo method and are valued at the lower of cost or market value this valuation requires us to make judgments based on currentlyavailable information about the likely method of disposition such as through sales to individual customers returns to product vendors or liquidations and expected recoverable values of each disposition category
we provide fulfillment by amazon services in connection with certain of our sellers programs thirdparty sellers maintain ownership of their inventory regardless of whether fulfillment is provided by us or the thirdparty sellers and therefore these products are not included in our inventories
we also purchase electronic device components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products during the normal course of business in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers a portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements consists of firm noncancellable commitments these commitments are based on forecasted customer demand if we reduce these commitments we may incur additional costs
accounts receivable net and other
included in accounts receivable net and other on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to customer and seller receivables and vendor receivables as of december   and  customer and seller receivables net were  billion and  billion and vendor receivables net were  billion and  billion
we estimate losses on receivables based on known troubled accounts and historical experience of losses incurred receivables are considered impaired and writtenoff when it is probable that all contractual payments due will not be collected in accordance with the terms of the agreement the allowance for doubtful accounts was  million  million and  million as of december    and  additions to the allowance were  million  million and  million and deductions to the allowance were  million  million and  million in   and 
internaluse software and website development
costs incurred to develop software for internal use and our websites are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the software costs related to design or maintenance of internaluse software and website development are expensed as incurred for the years ended   and  we capitalized  million including  million of stockbased compensation  million including  million of stockbased compensation and  million including  million of stockbased compensation of costs associated with internaluse software and website development amortization of previously capitalized amounts was  million  million and  million for   and 
property and equipment net
property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation property includes buildings and land that we own along with property we have acquired under buildtosuit financing and capital lease arrangements equipment includes assets such as furniture and fixtures heavy equipment servers and networking equipment and internaluse software and website development depreciation is recorded on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets generally the lesser of  years or the remaining life of the underlying building two years for assets such as internaluse software three years for our servers five years for networking equipment five years for furniture and fixtures and ten years for heavy equipment depreciation expense is classified within the corresponding operating expense categories on our consolidated statements of operations
leases and asset retirement obligations
we categorize leases at their inception as either operating or capital leases on certain of our lease agreements we may receive rent holidays and other incentives we recognize lease costs on a straightline basis without regard to deferred payment terms such as rent holidays that defer the commencement date of required payments additionally incentives we receive are treated as a reduction of our costs over the term of the agreement leasehold improvements are capitalized at cost and amortized over the lesser of their expected useful life or the noncancellable term of the lease
we establish assets and liabilities for the estimated construction costs incurred under buildtosuit lease arrangements to the extent we are involved in the construction of structural improvements or take construction risk prior to commencement of a


table of contents


lease upon occupancy of facilities under buildtosuit leases we assess whether these arrangements qualify for sales recognition under the saleleaseback accounting guidance if we continue to be the deemed owner the facilities are accounted for as finance leases
we establish assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire longlived assets at the termination or expiration of a lease such assets are depreciated over the lease period into operating expense and the recorded liabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated retirement costs
goodwill
we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable in testing for goodwill impairment we may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if our qualitative assessment indicates that goodwill impairment is more likely than not we perform a twostep impairment test we test goodwill for impairment under the twostep impairment test by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units if the fair value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value we estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses based primarily on expected category expansion pricing market segment share and general economic conditions
during the second quarter of  we changed the measurement date of our annual goodwill impairment test from october  to april  this change was not material to our consolidated financial statements as it did not result in the delay acceleration or avoidance of an impairment charge we believe this timing better aligns the goodwill impairment test with our strategic business planning process which is a key component of the goodwill impairment test we completed the required annual testing of goodwill for impairment for all reporting units as of april   and determined that goodwill is not impaired there were no triggering events identified from the date of our assessment through december   that would require an update to our annual impairment test see note acquisitions goodwill and acquired intangible assets
other assets
included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to acquired intangible assets net of amortization video and music content net of amortization longterm deferred tax assets certain equity investments marketable securities restricted for longer than one year the majority of which are attributable to collateralization of bank guarantees and debt related to our international operations intellectual property rights net of amortization and equity warrant assets
video and music content
we obtain video and music content to be made available to prime members through licensing agreements that have a wide range of licensing provisions and generally have terms from one to five years with fixed payment schedules when the license fee for a specific movie television or music title is determinable or reasonably estimable and available for streaming we recognize an asset representing the fee per title and a corresponding liability for the amounts owed we relieve the liability as payments are made and we amortize the asset to cost of sales on a straightline basis or on an accelerated basis based on estimated viewing patterns over each titles contractual window of availability which typically ranges from six months to five years if we are unable to reasonably estimate the cost per title no asset or liability is recorded and licensing costs are expensed as incurred we also develop original content the production costs of internally developed content are capitalized only if persuasive evidence exists that the production will generate revenue prior to  because we had limited history to support the economic benefits of our content we generally expensed such costs as incurred in  we began capitalizing a portion of production costs as we have developed more experience to support that future revenue will be earned capitalized internally developed costs are generally amortized to cost of sales on an accelerated basis that follows the viewing pattern of customer streams in the first months after availability
investments
we generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short to intermediateterm fixed income securities and aaarated money market funds such investments are included in cash and cash equivalents or marketable securities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets classified as availableforsale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive loss
equity investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting if the investment gives us the ability to exercise significant influence but not control over an investee equitymethod investments are included within other assets


table of contents


on our consolidated balance sheets our share of the earnings or losses as reported by equitymethod investees amortization of basis differences and related gains or losses if any are classified as equitymethod investment activity net of tax on our consolidated statements of operations
equity investments without readily determinable fair values and for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for using the cost method of accounting and classified as other assets on our consolidated balance sheets under the cost method investments are carried at cost and are adjusted only for otherthantemporary declines in fair value certain distributions and additional investments
equity investments that have readily determinable fair values are classified as availableforsale and are included in marketable securities on our consolidated balance sheets and are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses net of tax included in accumulated other comprehensive loss
we periodically evaluate whether declines in fair values of our investments below their book value are otherthantemporary this evaluation consists of several qualitative and quantitative factors regarding the severity and duration of the unrealized loss as well as our ability and intent to hold the investment until a forecasted recovery occurs additionally we assess whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell any investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis factors considered include quoted market prices recent financial results and operating trends implied values from any recent transactions or offers of investee securities credit quality of debt instrument issuers other publicly available information that may affect the value of our investments duration and severity of the decline in value and our strategy and intentions for holding the investment
longlived assets
longlived assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used or any other significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable
for longlived assets used in operations impairment losses are only recorded if the assets carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted probabilityweighted future cash flows we measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value longlived assets are considered held for sale when certain criteria are met including when management has committed to a plan to sell the asset the asset is available for sale in its immediate condition and the sale is probable within one year of the reporting date assets held for sale are reported at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell assets held for sale were not significant as of december   or

in july  the fasb issued an asu modifying the accounting for inventory under this asu the measurement principle for inventory will change from lower of cost or market value to lower of cost and net realizable value the asu defines net realizable value as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion disposal and transportation the asu is applicable to inventory that is accounted for under the firstin firstout method and is effective for reporting periods after december   with early adoption permitted we do not expect adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

as of december   our federal foreign and state net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately  billion  billion and  billion the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards are subject to limitations under section  of the internal revenue code and applicable state tax law if not utilized a portion of the federal foreign and state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in   and  respectively as of december   our tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately  million if not utilized a portion of the tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 
the companys consolidated balance sheets reflect deferred tax assets related to net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards excluding amounts resulting from excess stockbased compensation amounts related to excess stockbased compensation are accounted for as an increase to additional paidin capital if and when realized through a reduction in income taxes payable
tax contingencies
we are subject to income taxes in the us federal and state and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes during the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we establish reserves for taxrelated uncertainties based on estimates of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due these reserves are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the outcome of tax audits the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate

as of december   we had  billion of tax contingencies of which  million if fully recognized would decrease our effective tax rate
as of december   and  we had accrued interest and penalties net of federal income tax benefit related to tax contingencies of  million and  million interest and penalties net of federal income tax benefit recognized for the years ended december    and  was  million  million and  million
we are under examination or may be subject to examination by the internal revenue service irs for the calendar year  and thereafter these examinations may lead to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes or our net operating losses with respect to years under examination as well as subsequent periods as previously disclosed we have received notices of proposed adjustment from the irs for transactions undertaken in the  and  calendar years relating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries the irs is seeking to increase our us taxable income by an amount that would result in additional federal tax of approximately  billion subject to interest to date we have not resolved this matter administratively and are currently contesting it in us tax court we continue to disagree with these irs positions and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter in addition to the risk of additional tax for  and  transactions if this litigation is adversely determined or if the irs were to seek transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature for transactions in subsequent years we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities
certain of our subsidiaries are under examination or investigation or may be subject to examination or investigation by the french tax administration fta for calendar year  and thereafter these examinations may lead to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes in september  we received proposed tax assessment notices for calendar years  through  relating to the allocation of income between foreign jurisdictions in june  we received final tax collection notices for these years assessing additional french tax of  million including interest and penalties through september  we disagree with the assessment and intend to contest it vigorously we plan to pursue all available administrative remedies at the fta and if we are not able to resolve this matter with the fta we plan to pursue judicial remedies in addition to the risk of additional tax for years  through  if this litigation is adversely determined or if the fta were to seek adjustments of a similar nature for subsequent years we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities in addition in october  the european commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with european union rules on state aid if this matter is adversely resolved luxembourg may be required to assess and we may be required to pay additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and our taxes in the future could increase we are also subject to taxation in various states and other foreign jurisdictions including canada china germany india japan luxembourg and the united kingdom we are under or may be subject to audit or examination and additional assessments in respect of these particular jurisdictions for  and thereafter
we expect the total amount of tax contingencies will grow in  in addition changes in state federal and foreign tax laws may increase our tax contingencies the timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain and the amounts ultimately paid if any upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued it is reasonably possible that within the next  months we will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of income tax examinations in one or more jurisdictions these assessments or settlements may or may not result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on tax filings in years through  the actual amount of any change could vary significantly depending on the ultimate timing and nature of any settlements we cannot currently provide an estimate of the range of possible outcomes
