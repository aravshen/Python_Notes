business
overview
as our founders larry and sergey wrote in the original founders letter google is not a conventional company we do not intend to become one as part of that they also explained that you could expect us to make smaller bets in areas that might seem very speculative or even strange when compared to our current businesses from the start the company has always strived to do more and to do important and meaningful things with the resources we have
to help accelerate this we announced plans in august  to create a new public holding company called alphabet alphabet is a collection of businesses  the largest of which of course is google it also includes businesses that we combine as other bets and generally are pretty far afield of our main internet products such as verily calico x nest gv google capital and accessgoogle fiber our alphabet structure is about helping businesses within alphabet prosper through strong leaders and independence
at google our innovations in search and advertising have made our website widely used and our brand one of the most recognized in the world we generate revenues primarily by delivering online advertising that consumers find relevant and that advertisers find costeffective googles core products such as search android maps chrome youtube google play and gmail each have over one billion monthly active users and we believe we are just beginning to scratch the surface googles vision is to remain a place of incredible creativity and innovation that uses our technical expertise to tackle big problems our other bets are also making important strides in their industries and our goal is for them to become thriving successful businesses in the long term
serving our users
in many ways google search  and the clean white page with the blinking cursor  is a metaphor for how we think about innovation imagining the ways things could be  without constraint  is the process we use to look for better answers to some of lifes everyday problems its about starting with the what if and then working relentlessly to see if we can find the answer
its been that way from the beginning providing ways to access knowledge and information has been core to google and our products have come a long way in the last decade we used to show just ten blue links in our results you had to click through to different websites to get your answers which took time now we are increasingly able to provide direct answers  even if youre speaking your question using voice search  which makes it quicker easier and more natural to find what youre looking for
over time we have added other services that let you access information quickly and easily what if we could develop a smarter email service with plenty of storage thats gmail what if we could make a simpler speedier safer browser thats chrome what if we could provide easy access to movies books music and apps no matter which device youre on thats google play what if developers could use googles infrastructure to easily build and scale applications and what if people could collaborate and get work done from anywhere on any device thats cloud and apps
as devices proliferate its more and more important to ensure that you can navigate effortlessly across them  that the technology gets out of the way so you can move through this multiscreen world as easily as possible its why were investing so much in platforms like our chrome browser chrome os and our android mobile operating system ultimately we want you to have speedy secure access to whatever you need wherever you happen to be and on whatever device you may be using at the time
ads as answers
we asked what if ads werent intrusive and annoying what if we could deliver a relevant ad at just the right time and give people useful commercial information what if we could provide products that allow for better attribution and measurement across screens so that we show great ads for the right people
our advertising solutions help millions of companies grow their businesses and we offer a wide range of products across screens and devices we generate revenues primarily by delivering both performance advertising and brand advertising

performance advertising creates and delivers relevant ads that users will click leading to direct engagement with advertisers most of our performance advertisers pay us when a user engages in their ads performance advertising lets our advertisers connect with users while driving measurable results


table of contents
alphabet inc and google inc

for performance advertisers adwords our primary auctionbased advertising program helps create simple textbased ads that appear on google websites and the websites of google network members who use our advertising programs to deliver relevant ads alongside their search results and content in addition our partners that comprise the google network use our adsense program to deliver relevant ads that generate revenues and enhance the user experience these programs let both small and large businesses connect with users looking for a specific item say a pair of shoes or a plane ticket back home to that end we continue to invest in our advertising programs and to make significant upgrades including estimated total conversions which help advertisers measure the effectiveness of their campaigns in a multiscreen world

brand advertising helps enhance users awareness of and affinity with advertisers products and services through videos text images and other interactive ads that run across various devices we help brand advertisers deliver digital videos and other types of ads to specific audiences for their brandbuilding marketing campaigns and in turn generate revenue by distributing their ads such as the trueview ads displayed on our youtube videos
we have built a worldclass ad technology platform for brand advertisers agencies and publishers to power their digital marketing businesses we aim to ensure great user experiences by serving the right ads at the right time and by building deep partnerships with brands and agencies we also seek to improve the measurability of the effectiveness of brand advertising
furthermore we have invested significantly in programmatic advertising to help advertisers reach users when and where it matters giving them access to toptier inventory across screens and formats as well as the realtime insights that advertisers need to make their buys count
we have allocated substantial resources to stopping bad advertising practices and protecting users on the web we focus on creating the best advertising experiences for our users and advertisers in many ways ranging from removing hundreds of millions of bad ads from our systems every year to closely monitoring the sites and apps that show our ads and blacklisting them when necessary to ensure that our ads do not fund bad content
bringing the next  billion online
fast search and highquality ads matter only if you have access to the internet right now only a fraction of the seven billion people in the world are fortunate enough to be able to get online that leaves out billions of people with so much useful and lifechanging information available today it is unfortunate that such a significant portion of the worlds population lacks even the most basic internet connection
those people will be able to learn and start businesses to grow and prosper in ways they simply could not without an internet connection creating platforms for other peoples success is a huge part of who we are we want the world to join us online and to be greeted with the best possible experience once they get there connection is powerful and we are working hard to make it a reality for everyone the opportunities to improve lives on a grand scale are endless
and there are people around the world whose lives we can improve every day by bringing information into their homes into their schools and into their pockets  showing them just how powerful the simple idea of getting online can be
at google we are helping people get online by tailoring hardware and software experiences that suit the needs of emerging markets primarily through android and chrome were also making sure our core google apps are fast and useful especially for users in areas where speed size and connectivity are central concerns
other alphabet companies are pursuing initiatives with similar goals too thats why were investing in new projects like project loon we asked what if we could use a network of balloons that could fly at the edge of space and provide connectivity in rural and remote areas loon has helped students in brazil and farmers in new zealand experience the power of an internet connection for the first time and as the program expands we hope to bring this to more and more people  creating opportunities that simply did not exist before for millions of people all around the world
moonshots
the idea of trying new things is reflected in some of our new ambitious projects both within google and other bets everything might not fit into a neat little box we believe that is exactly how to stay relevant many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done making only incremental changes this incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time especially in technology where change tends to be revolutionary not evolutionary people thought we were crazy when we acquired youtube and android and when we launched chrome but as those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices and a safer popular browser respectively we continue to look towards the future and continue to invest for the longterm

we wont become complacent relying solely on small tweaks as the years wear on as we said in the  founders ipo letter we will not shy away from highrisk highreward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our longterm success we wont stop asking what if and then working hard to find the answer
as explained in the letter from our ceo in august  our alphabet reorganization was implemented to better allow us to structure teams in ways that we believe will produce the fastest most focused innovation possible for moonshot projects
research
we continue to invest in our existing products and services including search and advertising as well as developing new products and services through research and product development we often release earlystage products we then use data and user feedback to decide if and how to invest further in those products
our research and development expenses which includes the vast majority of engineering and technical headcount responsible for research and development as well as their associated costs were  billion  billion and  billion in   and  respectively which included stockbased compensation expense of  billion  billion and  billion respectively we expect to continue investing in hiring talented employees and building systems to develop new products and services and improve existing ones
competition
our business is characterized by rapid change as well as new and disruptive technologies we face formidable competition in every aspect of our business particularly from companies that seek to connect people with online information and provide them with relevant advertising we face competition from

general purpose search engines and information services such as yahoo microsofts bing yandex baidu naver webcrawler and mywebsearch

vertical search engines and ecommerce websites such as kayak travel queries linkedin job queries webmd health queries and amazon and ebay ecommerce some users will navigate directly to such content websites and apps rather than go through google

social networks such as facebook and twitter some users are increasingly relying on social networks for product or service referrals rather than seeking information through traditional search engines

other forms of advertising such as television radio newspapers magazines billboards and yellow pages our advertisers typically advertise in multiple media both online and offline

other online advertising platforms and networks including criteo appnexus and facebook that compete for advertisers with adwords our primary auctionbased advertising program

other operating systems and mobile device companies

providers of online products and services that provide answers information and services a number of our online products and services including gmail youtube and google docs compete directly with new and established companies which offer communication information storage and entertainment services either on a standalone basis or integrated into other offerings
competing successfully depends heavily on our ability to rapidly deliver innovative products and technologies to the marketplace so that we can attract and retain

users for whom other products and services are literally one click away primarily on the basis of the relevance and usefulness of our search results and the features availability and ease of use of our products and services

advertisers primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads and ultimately customers and to deliver their advertisements in an efficient and effective manner across a variety of distribution channels

content providers google network members the parties who use our advertising programs to deliver relevant ads alongside their search results and content as well as other content providers for whom we distribute or license content primarily based on the quality of our advertiser base our ability to help these partners generate revenues from advertising and the terms of our agreements with them
intellectual property
we rely on various intellectual property laws confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brand we have registered and applied for the registration of us and international trademarks service marks domain names and copyrights we have also filed patent applications in the us and foreign


table of contents
alphabet inc and google inc

countries covering certain of our technology and acquired patent assets to supplement our portfolio we have licensed in the past and expect that we may license in the future certain of our rights to other parties
culture and employees
we take great pride in our culture we embrace collaboration and creativity and encourage the iteration of ideas to address complex technical challenges transparency and open dialogue are central to how we work and we like to ensure that company news reaches our employees first through internal channels
despite our rapid growth we still cherish our roots as a startup and wherever possible empower employees to act on great ideas regardless of their role or function within the company we strive to hire great employees with backgrounds and perspectives as diverse as those of our global users we work to provide an environment where these talented people can have fulfilling careers addressing some of the biggest challenges in technology and society
our employees are among our best assets and are critical for our continued success we expect to continue investing in hiring talented employees and to provide competitive compensation programs to our employees as of december   we had  fulltime employees  in research and development  in sales and marketing  in operations and  in general and administrative functions although we have work councils and statutory employee representation obligations in certain countries our us employees are not represented by a labor union competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense particularly for software engineers computer scientists and other technical staff
seasonality
our business is affected by both seasonal fluctuations in internet usage and traditional retail seasonality internet usage generally slows during the summer months and commercial queries typically increase significantly in the fourth quarter of each year

risk factors
our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described below which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the trading price of our common and capital stock
risks related to our businesses and industries
we face intense competition if we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users we may not remain competitive and our revenues and operating results could be adversely affected
our businesses are rapidly evolving intensely competitive and subject to changing technologies shifting user needs and frequent introductions of new products and services competing successfully depends heavily on our ability to deliver innovative products and technologies to the marketplace rapidly and for google provide products and services that make our search results and ads relevant and useful for our users as our businesses evolve the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a wider range of products and services including products and services that may be outside of our historical core business
we have many competitors in different industries including general purpose search engines and information services vertical search engines and ecommerce websites social networks providers of online products and services other forms of advertising and online advertising platforms and networks other operating systems and wireless mobile device companies our current and potential domestic and international competitors range from large and established companies to emerging startups established companies have longer operating histories and more established relationships with customers and users and they can use their experiences and resources in ways that could affect our competitive position including by making acquisitions continuing to invest heavily in research and development aggressively initiating intellectual property claims whether or not meritorious and continuing to compete aggressively for advertisers and websites emerging startups may be able to innovate and provide products and services faster than we can or may foresee the consumer need for products and services before us
our competitors are constantly developing innovations in search online advertising wireless mobile devices operating systems and many other webbased products and services the research and development of new technologically advanced products is also a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation and investment as well as the accurate anticipation of technology market trends and consumer needs as a result we must continue to invest significant resources in research and development including through acquisitions in order to enhance our search technology and our existing products and services and introduce new products and services that people can easily and effectively use if we are unable to provide quality products and services then acceptance rates for our products and services could decline in addition these new products and services may present new and difficult technological and legal challenges and we may be subject to claims if users of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other issues our operating results would also suffer if our innovations are not responsive to the needs of our users advertisers and google network members are not appropriately timed with market opportunities or are not effectively brought to market as technology continues to develop our competitors may be able to offer user experiences that are or that are seen to be substantially similar to or better than ours this may force us to compete in different ways and expend significant resources in order to remain competitive if our competitors are more successful than we are in developing compelling products or in attracting and retaining users advertisers and content providers our revenues and operating results could be adversely affected
our ongoing investment in new businesses and new products services and technologies is inherently risky and could disrupt our ongoing businesses
we have invested and expect to continue to invest in new businesses products services and technologies such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including insufficient revenues from such investments to offset any new liabilities assumed and expenses associated with these new investments inadequate return of capital on our investments distraction of management from current operations and unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence of such strategies and offerings that could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such investments and incur unanticipated liabilities because these new ventures are inherently risky no assurance can be given that such strategies and offerings will be successful and will not adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results

more people are using devices other than desktop computers to access the internet and accessing new devices to make search queries if manufacturers and users do not widely adopt versions of our search technology products or operating systems developed for these devices our business could be adversely affected
the number of people who access the internet through devices other than desktop computers including mobile phones smartphones handheld computers such as netbooks and tablets video game consoles and television settop devices is increasing dramatically the functionality and user experience associated with some alternative devices may make the use of our products and services through such devices more difficult or just different and the versions of our products and services developed for these devices may not be compelling to users manufacturers or distributors of alternative devices each manufacturer or distributor may establish unique technical standards for its devices and our products and services may not work or be viewable on these devices as a result some manufacturers may also elect not to include our products on their devices in addition search queries are increasingly being undertaken via apps tailored to particular devices or social media platforms which could affect our search and advertising business over time as new devices and platforms are continually being released it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in adapting our products and services and developing competitive new products and services we expect to continue to devote significant resources to the creation support and maintenance of products and services across multiple platforms and devices if we are unable to attract and retain a substantial number of alternative device manufacturers distributors developers and users to our products and services or if we are slow to develop products and technologies that are more compatible with alternative devices and platforms we will fail to capture the opportunities available as consumers and advertisers transition to a dynamic multiscreen environment
we generate a significant portion of our revenues from advertising and reduced spending by advertisers or a loss of partners could seriously harm our business
we generated  of total google segment revenues from advertising in  many of our advertisers companies that distribute our products and services digital publishers and content partners can terminate their contracts with us at any time those partners may not continue to do business with us if we do not create more value such as increased numbers of users or customers new sales leads increased brand awareness or more effective monetization than their available alternatives if we do not provide superior value or deliver advertisements efficiently and competitively we could see a decrease in revenue and other adverse impacts to our business adverse macroeconomic conditions can also have a material negative impact on advertising revenues which could adversely affect our revenues and business
in addition expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns adverse macroeconomic conditions can also have a material negative impact on the demand for advertising and cause our advertisers to reduce the amounts they spend on advertising which could adversely affect our revenues and business
our revenue growth rate could decline over time and we anticipate downward pressure on our operating margin in the future
our revenue growth rate could decline over time as a result of a number of factors including

increasing competition

changes in property mix platform mix and geographical mix

the challenges in maintaining our growth rate as our revenues increase to higher levels

the evolution of the online advertising market including the increasing variety of online platforms for advertising and the other markets in which we participate and

the rate of user adoption of our products services and technologies
we believe our margins could experience downward pressure as a result of increasing competition and increased costs for many aspects of our business for instance the margin on revenues we generate from our google network members is significantly less than the margin on revenues we generate from advertising on google websites consequently our margins will experience downward pressure if a greater percentage of our revenues comes from ads placed on our google network members websites compared to revenues generated through ads placed on google websites additionally the margin we earn on revenues generated from our google network members could decrease in the future if we pay an even larger percentage of advertising fees to our google network members
additionally our margins could experience downward pressure because the margin on the sale of digital content and apps advertising revenues from mobile devices and newer advertising formats are generally less than the margin on revenues we generate from advertising on our websites or traditional formats further our margins could be impacted

adversely if we spend a proportionately larger amount to promote or distribute certain products or if we invest more heavily in our rd efforts across the company such as our other bets businesses than we have historically
we are subject to increased regulatory scrutiny that may negatively impact our business
the growth of our company and our expansion into a variety of new fields involves a variety of new regulatory issues and we have experienced increased regulatory scrutiny as we have grown for instance several regulatory agencies have sought to review our search and other businesses on potential competition concerns we continue to cooperate with the european commission ec and other regulatory authorities around the world in investigations they are conducting with respect to our business and its impact on competition legislators and regulators may make legal and regulatory changes or interpret and apply existing laws in ways that make our products and services less useful to our users require us to incur substantial costs expose us to unanticipated civil or criminal liability or cause us to change our business practices these changes or increased costs could negatively impact our business and results of operations in material ways
we are regularly subject to claims suits government investigations and other proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes
we are regularly subject to claims suits and government investigations involving competition intellectual property privacy consumer protection tax labor and employment commercial disputes content generated by our users goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms and other matters the sale of hardware products also exposes us to the risk of product liability and other litigation involving assertions about product defects as well as health and safety hazardous materials usage and other environmental concerns in addition our businesses face intellectual property litigation as further discussed later that exposes us to the risk of exclusion and cease and desist orders which could limit our ability to sell products and services
such claims suits and government investigations are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty regardless of the outcome any of these types of legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs diversion of management resources and other factors determining reserves for our pending litigation is a complex factintensive process that requires significant judgment it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in substantial fines and penalties that could adversely affect our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows in a particular period these proceedings could also result in reputational harm criminal sanctions consent decrees or orders preventing us from offering certain features functionalities products or services requiring a change in our business practices or product recalls or other field action or requiring development of noninfringing or otherwise altered products or technologies any of these consequences could adversely affect our business and results of operations
acquisitions could result in operating difficulties dilution and other consequences that may adversely impact our business and results of operations
acquisitions are an important element of our overall corporate strategy and use of capital and these transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations we expect to continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of potential strategic transactions the process of integrating an acquired company business or technology has created and will continue to create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures the areas where we face risks include

diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to acquisition integration challenges

failure to successfully further develop the acquired business or technology

implementation or remediation of controls procedures and policies at the acquired company

integration of the acquired companys accounting human resource and other administrative systems and coordination of product engineering and sales and marketing functions

transition of operations users and customers onto our existing platforms

failure to obtain required approvals on a timely basis if at all from governmental authorities or conditions placed upon approval under competition laws which could among other things delay or prevent us from completing a transaction or otherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of an acquisition or investment

in the case of foreign acquisitions the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic currency political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries

cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization and retention of employees from the businesses we acquire

liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition including patent and trademark infringement claims privacy issues violations of laws commercial disputes tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities

litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company including claims from terminated employees customers former stockholders or other third parties
our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally
our acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses or impairment of goodwill andor purchased longlived assets and restructuring charges any of which could harm our financial condition or results also the anticipated benefits or value of our acquisitions or investments may not materialize
our business depends on a strong brand and failing to maintain and enhance our brand would hurt our ability to expand our base of users advertisers google network members and other partners
our strong google brand has significantly contributed to the success of our business maintaining and enhancing the brands of both google and other bets increases our ability to enter new categories and launch new and innovative products that better serve the needs of our users our brands may be negatively impacted by a number of factors including among others reputational issues and producttechnical performance failures further if we fail to maintain and enhance equity in the google brand our business operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected maintaining and enhancing our brand will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide highquality innovative products and services that are truly useful and play a meaningful role in peoples everyday lives
a variety of new and existing laws could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business
we are subject to numerous us and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters new laws and regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations may also impact our business for example current and new patent laws such as us patent laws and european patent laws may affect the ability of companies including us to protect their innovations and defend against claims of patent infringement the costs of compliance with these laws and regulations are high and are likely to increase in the future
claims have been or may be threatened and filed against us under both us and foreign laws for defamation invasion of privacy and other tort claims unlawful activity patent copyright and trademark infringement product liability or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched and the ads posted by our users our products and services or content generated by our users furthermore many of these laws do not contemplate or address the unique issues raised by a number of our new businesses products services and technologies in addition the applicability and scope of these laws as interpreted by the courts remain uncertain for example the laws relating to the liability of providers of online services are currently unsettled both within the us and abroad
in addition other laws that could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business include among others

the digital millennium copyright act which has provisions that limit in the us but do not necessarily eliminate our liability for caching or hosting or for listing or linking to thirdparty websites that include materials that infringe copyrights or other rights so long as we comply with the statutory requirements of this act any future legislation impacting these safe harbors may adversely impact us

court decisions such as the right to be forgotten ruling issued by the european court which allows individuals to demand that google remove search results about them in certain instances may limit the content we can show to our users

various us and international laws that restrict the distribution of materials considered harmful to children and impose additional restrictions on the ability of online services to collect information from minors

data protection laws passed by many states that require notification to users when there is a security breach for personal data such as californias information practices act

data localization laws which generally mandate that certain types of data collected in a particular country be stored andor processed within that country

we face risks and costs overseas as our products and services are offered in international markets and may be subject to additional regulations any failure on our part to comply with these laws and regulations can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort and may subject us to significant liabilities and other penalties
we are and may in the future be subject to intellectual property or other claims which are costly to defend could result in significant damage awards and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future
internet technology media and other companies own large numbers of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights in addition patent holding companies may continue to seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained as we have grown the intellectual property rights claims against us have increased and may continue to increase as we develop new products services and technologies
we have had patent copyright and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products services and technologies infringe the intellectual property rights of others third parties have also sought broad injunctive relief against us by filing claims in us and international courts and the us international trade commission itc for exclusion and cease and desist orders which could limit our ability to sell our products or services in the us or elsewhere if our products or services or those of our customers or suppliers are found to infringe the intellectual property subject to the claims adverse results in any of these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages costly royalty or licensing agreements if licenses are available at all or orders preventing us from offering certain features functionalities products or services and may also cause us to change our business practices and require development of noninfringing products or technologies which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business
furthermore in connection with our divestitures we have agreed and may in the future agree to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities in addition many of our agreements with our customers and partners including certain suppliers require us to indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement claims against them which could increase our costs as a result of defending such claims and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims such customers and partners may also discontinue the use of our products services and technologies as a result of injunctions or otherwise which could result in loss of revenues and adversely impact our business moreover intellectual property indemnities provided to us by our suppliers when obtainable may not cover all damages and losses suffered by us and our customers from covered products
regardless of the merits of the claims intellectual property claims are often time consuming expensive to litigate or settle and cause significant diversion of management attention to the extent such intellectual property infringement claims are successful they may have an adverse effect on our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows
our intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products services and brand
our patents trademarks trade secrets copyrights and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights as well as to our products services and technologies for example effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed or made available through the internet also the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective
although we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovations it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations moreover we may not have adequate patent or copyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important furthermore there is always the possibility despite our efforts that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable
we also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets the secrecy could be compromised by outside parties or by our employees which could cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secrets
we also face risks associated with our trademarks for example there is a risk that the word google could become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word search if this happens we could lose protection for this trademark which could result in other people using the word google to refer to their own products thus diminishing our brand

any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete also protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results
we may be subject to legal liability associated with providing online services or content
we host and provide a wide variety of services and products that enable users to exchange information advertise products and services conduct business and engage in various online activities both domestically and internationally the law relating to the liability of providers of these online services and products for activities of their users is still somewhat unsettled both within the us and internationally claims have been threatened and have been brought against us for defamation negligence breaches of contract copyright or trademark infringement unfair competition unlawful activity tort including personal injury fraud or other theories based on the nature and content of information that we publish or to which we provide links or that may be posted online or generated by us or by third parties including our users in addition we are and have been and may again in the future be subject to domestic or international actions alleging that certain content we have generated or thirdparty content that we have made available within our services violates us and nonus law
we also arrange for the distribution of thirdparty advertisements to thirdparty publishers and advertising networks and we offer thirdparty products services or content we may be subject to claims concerning these products services or content by virtue of our involvement in marketing branding broadcasting or providing access to them even if we do not ourselves host operate provide or provide access to these products services or content defense of any such actions could be costly and involve significant time and attention of our management and other resources may result in monetary liabilities or penalties and may require us to change our business in an adverse manner
privacy concerns relating to our technology could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users from using our products and services
from time to time concerns have been expressed about whether our products services or processes compromise the privacy of users and others concerns about our practices with regard to the collection use disclosure or security of personal information or other privacy related matters even if unfounded could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results
in addition as nearly all of our products and services are webbased the amount of data we store for our users on our servers including personal information has been increasing any systems failure or compromise of our security that results in the release of our users data could seriously limit the adoption of our products and services as well as harm our reputation and brand and therefore our business we expect to continue to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches the risk that these types of events could seriously harm our business is likely to increase as we expand the number of webbased products and services we offer and operate in more countries
regulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection including measures to ensure that our encryption of users data does not hinder law enforcement agencies access to that data in addition the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the us europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices if so in addition to the possibility of fines this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business
recent legal developments in europe have created compliance uncertainty regarding certain transfers of information from europe to the us a preliminary agreement has been reached between the us and european governments to allow for legal certainty regarding transfers of data however given the preliminary nature of the agreement some uncertainty remains and compliance obligations could cause us to incur costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business
if our security measures are breached or if our services are subject to attacks that degrade or deny the ability of users to access our products and services our products and services may be perceived as not being secure users and customers may curtail or stop using our products and services and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure
our products and services involve the storage and transmission of users and customers proprietary information and security breaches expose us to a risk of loss of this information litigation and potential liability we experience cyber attacks of varying degrees on a regular basis our security measures may also be breached due to employee error malfeasance system errors or vulnerabilities or otherwise additionally outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees users or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our


table of contents
alphabet inc and google inc

data or our users or customers data any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure damage to our reputation and a loss of confidence in the security of our products and services that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose users and customers
we face a number of manufacturing and supply chain risks that if not properly managed could adversely impact our financial results and prospects
we face a number of risks related to manufacturing and supply chain management for instance the products we sell may have quality issues resulting from the design or manufacture of the product or from the software used in the product sometimes these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or suppliers if the quality of our products does not meet our customers expectations or our products are found to be defective then our sales and operating earnings and ultimately our reputation could be negatively impacted
we rely on third parties to manufacture many of our assemblies and finished products and we have thirdparty arrangements for the design of some components and parts our business could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage third parties with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms or if those we engage fail to meet their obligations whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons or make adverse changes in the pricing or other material terms of our arrangements with them
we have in the past and may experience in the future supply shortages and price increases driven by raw material availability manufacturing capacity labor shortages industry allocations natural disasters and significant changes in the financial or business condition of our suppliers workaround plans to address shortages could entail increased freight costs for expedited shipments we may experience shortages or other supply chain disruptions in the future that could negatively impact our operations in addition some of the components we use in our products are available only from a single source or limited sources and we may not be able to find replacement vendors on favorable terms or at all in the event of a supply chain disruption
additionally because many of our supply contracts have volumebased pricing or minimum purchase requirements if the volume of our hardware sales decreases or does not reach projected targets we could face increased materials and manufacturing costs or other financial liabilities that could make our hardware products more costly per unit to manufacture and therefore less competitive and negatively impact our financial results further certain of our competitors may negotiate more favorable contractual terms based on volume and other commitments that may provide them with competitive advantages and may impact our supply
we also require our suppliers and business partners to comply with law and company policies regarding workplace and employment practices data security environmental compliance and intellectual property licensing but we do not control them or their practices if any of them violates laws or implements practices regarded as unethical we could experience supply chain disruptions canceled orders terminations of or damage to key relationships and damage to our reputation if any of them fails to procure necessary license rights to thirdparty intellectual property legal action could ensue that could impact the saleability of our products and expose us to financial obligations to third parties
the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act includes disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries drc and procedures pertaining to a manufacturers efforts regarding the source of such minerals sec rules implementing these requirements may have the effect of reducing the pool of suppliers who can supply drc conflict free components and parts and we may not be able to obtain drc conflict free products or supplies in sufficient quantities for our operations since our supply chain is complex we may face reputational challenges with our customers stockholders and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for the minerals used in our products
web spam and content farms could decrease our search quality which could damage our reputation and deter our current and potential users from using our products and services
web spam refers to websites that attempt to violate a search engines quality guidelines or that otherwise seek to rank higher in search results than a search engines assessment of their relevance and utility would rank them
although englishlanguage web spam in our search results has been significantly reduced and web spam in most other languages is limited we expect web spammers will continue to seek ways to improve their rankings inappropriately we continuously combat web spam including through indexing technology that makes it harder for spamlike less useful web content to rank highly we face challenges from lowquality and irrelevant content websites including content farms which are websites that generate large quantities of lowquality content to help them improve


table of contents
alphabet inc and google inc

their search rankings we are continually launching algorithmic changes focused on lowquality websites if our search results display an increasing number of web spam and content farms this could hurt our reputation for delivering relevant information or reduce user traffic to our websites in addition as we continue to take actions to improve our search quality and reduce lowquality content this may in the short run reduce our adsense revenues since some of these websites are adsense partners
interruption or failure of our information technology and communications systems could hurt our ability to effectively provide our products and services which could damage our reputation and harm our operating results
the availability of our products and services depends on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes terrorist attacks natural disasters the effects of climate change such as sea level rise drought flooding wildfires and increased storm severity power loss telecommunications failures computer viruses computer denial of service attacks or other attempts to harm our systems some of our data centers are located in areas with a high risk of major earthquakes our data centers are also subject to breakins sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism and to potential disruptions if the operators of certain of these facilities have financial difficulties some of our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities the occurrence of a natural disaster a decision to close a facility we are using or other unanticipated problems at our data centers could result in lengthy interruptions in our service in addition our products and services are highly technical and complex and may contain errors or vulnerabilities which could result in interruptions in our services or the failure of our systems
our international operations expose us to additional risks that could harm our business operating results and financial condition
our international operations are significant to our revenues and net income and we plan to continue to grow internationally international revenues accounted for approximately  of our consolidated revenues in  in certain international markets we have limited operating experience and may not benefit from any firsttomarket advantages or otherwise succeed
in addition to risks described elsewhere in this section our international operations expose us to other risks including the following

changes in local political economic regulatory tax social and labor conditions which may adversely harm our business

restrictions on foreign ownership and investments and stringent foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the us

import and export requirements tariffs trade disputes and barriers and customs classifications that may prevent us from offering products or providing services to a particular market and may increase our operating costs

longer payment cycles in some countries increased credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud

still developing foreign laws and legal systems

uncertainty regarding liability for services and content including uncertainty as a result of local laws and lack of legal precedent

different employeeemployer relationships existence of workers councils and labor unions and other challenges caused by distance language and cultural differences making it harder to do business in certain jurisdictions
in addition compliance with complex foreign and us laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business these numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include internal control and disclosure rules privacy and data protection requirements anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials and competition regulations among others violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries and could also materially affect our brand our international growth efforts our ability to attract and retain employees our business and our operating results although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies

finally since we conduct business in currencies other than us dollars but report our financial results in us dollars we face exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenues and earnings additionally hedging programs are inherently risky and could expose us to additional risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations
our operating results may fluctuate which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations
our operating results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors many outside of our control as a result comparing our operating results on a periodtoperiod basis may not be meaningful and you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance our quarterly yeartodate and annual expenses as a percentage of our revenues may differ significantly from our historical or projected rates our operating results in future quarters may fall below expectations any of these events could cause our stock price to fall each of the risk factors listed in this section in addition to the following factors may affect our operating results

our ability to continue to attract users to our websites and retain existing users on our websites

our ability to monetize or generate revenues from traffic on google websites and our google network members websites both on desktop and mobile devices

revenue fluctuations caused by changes in property mix platform mix and geographical mix

the amount of revenues and expenses generated and incurred in currencies other than us dollars and our ability to manage the resulting risk through our foreign exchange risk management program

the amount and timing of operating costs and expenses and capital expenditures related to the maintenance and expansion of our businesses operations and infrastructure

our focus on longterm goals over shortterm results

the results of our acquisitions and our investments in risky projects including new businesses products services and technologies

our ability to keep our websites operational at a reasonable cost and without service interruptions

our ability to generate significant revenues from new products and services in which we have invested considerable time and resources
because our business is changing and evolving our historical operating results may not be useful to you in predicting our future operating results in addition advertising spending has historically been cyclical in nature reflecting overall economic conditions as well as budgeting and buying patterns also user traffic tends to be seasonal our rapid growth has tended to mask the cyclicality and seasonality of our business as our growth rate has slowed the cyclicality and seasonality in our business has become more pronounced and caused our operating results to fluctuate
if we were to lose the services of larry sergey eric sundar or other key personnel we may not be able to execute our business strategy
our future success depends in a large part upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team in particular larry page and sergey brin are critical to the overall management of alphabet and its subsidiaries and they along with sundar pichai the chief executive officer of google play an important role in the development of our technology along with our executive chairman eric e schmidt they also play a key role in maintaining our culture and setting our strategic direction all of our executive officers and key employees are atwill employees and we do not maintain any keyperson life insurance policies the loss of key personnel could seriously harm our business
we rely on highly skilled personnel and if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel hire qualified personnel or maintain our corporate culture we may not be able to grow effectively
our performance largely depends on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify hire develop motivate and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization competition in our industry for qualified employees is intense and certain of our competitors have directly targeted our employees in addition our compensation arrangements such as our equity award programs may not always be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees

in addition we believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation creativity and teamwork as our organization grows and we are required to implement more complex organizational management structures particularly in light of our holding company reorganization and new operating structure we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture this could negatively impact our future success
our business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the internet by us and our users internet access providers may be able to restrict block degrade or charge for access to certain of our products and services which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users and advertisers
our products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the internet and certain of our products require significant bandwidth to work effectively currently this access is provided by companies that have significant market power in the broadband and internet access marketplace including incumbent telephone companies cable companies mobile communications companies and governmentowned service providers some of these providers have taken or have stated that they may take measures including legal actions that could degrade disrupt or increase the cost of user access to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our offerings or by charging increased fees to us or our users to provide our offerings in addition in some jurisdictions our products and services have been subject to governmentinitiated restrictions or blockages such interference could result in a loss of existing users and advertisers and increased costs and could impair our ability to attract new users and advertisers thereby harming our revenues and growth
new technologies could block online ads which would harm our google business
technologies have been developed that can block the display of our ads and that provide tools to users to opt out of our advertising products most of our google revenues are derived from fees paid to us by advertisers in connection with the display of ads on web pages for our users as a result such technologies and tools could adversely affect our operating results
we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our investments
given the global nature of our business we have investments both domestically and internationally credit ratings and market values of these investments can be negatively impacted by liquidity credit deterioration or losses financial results foreign exchange rates or other factors as a result the value or liquidity of our cash equivalents and marketable securities could decline and result in a material impairment which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results
we may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities
our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates the net gains and losses recognized by legal entities on certain hedges and related hedged intercompany and other transactions under our foreign exchange risk management program changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities or changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles as well as certain discrete items we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities as a result we have received and may in the future receive assessments in multiple jurisdictions on various taxrelated assertions including transfer pricing adjustments or permanent establishment any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition in addition the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain although we believe our estimates are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made
risks related to ownership of our stock
the trading price for our class a common stock and nonvoting class c capital stock may continue to be volatile
the trading price of our stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility and may continue to be volatile for example from january   through december   the closing price of our class a common stock ranged from  per share to  per share and the closing price of our class c capital stock ranged from  to  per share
the trading price of our class a common stock and class c capital stock may fluctuate widely in response to various factors some of which are beyond our control these factors include among others

quarterly variations in our results of operations or those of our competitors

announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions new products significant contracts commercial relationships or capital commitments

recommendations by securities analysts or changes in earnings estimates

announcements about our earnings that are not in line with analyst expectations the risk of which is enhanced because it is our policy not to give guidance on earnings

announcements by our competitors of their earnings that are not in line with analyst expectations

commentary by industry and market professionals about our products strategies and other matters affecting our business and results regardless of its accuracy

the volume of shares of class a common stock and class c capital stock available for public sale

sales of class a common stock and class c capital stock by us or by our stockholders including sales by our directors executive officers and other employees

short sales hedging and other derivative transactions on shares of our class a common stock and class c capital stock

the perceived values of class a common stock and class c capital stock relative to one another

our stock repurchase program
in addition the stock market in general and the market for technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies these broad market and industry factors may harm the market price of our class a common stock and our class c capital stock regardless of our actual operating performance
we cannot guarantee that our recently announced stock repurchase program will be fully consummated or that our stock repurchase program will enhance longterm stockholder value and stock repurchases could increase the volatility of the price of our stock and could diminish our cash reserves
in october  our board of directors authorized our company to repurchase up to  of our class c capital stock and in january  our board of directors authorized our company to repurchase an additional amount of approximately  thousand shares the repurchase program does not have an expiration date although our board of directors has authorized a stock repurchase program the share repurchase program does not obligate alphabet to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares the stock repurchase program could affect the price of our stock and increase volatility and may be suspended or terminated at any time which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our stock
the concentration of our stock ownership limits our stockholders ability to influence corporate matters
our class b common stock has  votes per share our class a common stock has one vote per share and our class c capital stock has no voting rights as of december   larry sergey and eric beneficially owned approximately  of our outstanding class b common stock which represented approximately  of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock larry sergey and eric therefore have significant influence over management and affairs and over all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets for the foreseeable future in addition because our class c capital stock carries no voting rights except as required by applicable law the issuance of the class c capital stock including in future stockbased acquisition transactions and to fund employee equity incentive programs could prolong the duration of larry and sergeys current relative ownership of our voting power and their ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders together with eric they would also continue to be able to control any required stockholder vote with respect to certain change in control transactions involving alphabet including an acquisition of alphabet by another company
this concentrated control limits or severely restricts our stockholders ability to influence corporate matters and as a result we may take actions that our stockholders do not view as beneficial as a result the market price of our class a common stock and our class c capital stock could be adversely affected
provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable
provisions in alphabets certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management these provisions include the following


table of contents
alphabet inc and google inc


our certificate of incorporation provides for a triclass capital stock structure as a result of this structure larry sergey and eric have significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets this concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger takeover or other change of control transaction that other stockholders may view as beneficial as noted above the issuance of the class c capital stock could have the effect of prolonging the influence of larry sergey and eric

our board of directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation death or removal of a director which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors

our stockholders may not act by written consent as a result a holder or holders controlling a majority of our capital stock would not be able to take certain actions without holding a stockholders meeting

our certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors this limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates

stockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the board of directors or to propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders meeting these provisions may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirers own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company

our board of directors may issue without stockholder approval shares of undesignated preferred stock the ability to issue undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us
as a delaware corporation we are also subject to certain delaware antitakeover provisions under delaware law a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of  or more of its outstanding voting stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or among other things the board of directors has approved the transaction our board of directors could rely on delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us
risks related to our holding company reorganization
as a holding company alphabet will be dependent on the operations and funds of its subsidiaries
on october   we completed a reorganization pursuant to which alphabet became a holding company with no business operations of its own alphabets only significant assets are the outstanding equity interests in google and any other future subsidiaries of alphabet as a result we rely on cash flows from subsidiaries to meet our obligations including to service any debt obligations of alphabet
we may not obtain the anticipated benefits of our reorganization into a holding company structure
we believe that our holding company reorganization and a new operating structure will increase management scale and allow us to focus on running our diverse businesses independently with the goal of maximizing each of the business potential the anticipated benefits of this reorganization may not be obtained if circumstances prevent us from taking advantage of the strategic and business opportunities that we expect it may afford us as a result we may incur the costs of a holding company structure without realizing the anticipated benefits which could adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results
alphabets management is dedicating significant effort to the new operating structure these efforts may divert managements focus and resources from alphabets business corporate initiatives or strategic opportunities which could have an adverse effect on our businesses results of operations financial condition or prospects additionally our subsidiaries may be restricted in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions to alphabet as the new holding company

trends in our business
the following trends have contributed to the results of our consolidated operations and we anticipate that they will continue to impact our future results
users behaviors and advertising continue to shift online as the digital economy evolves
the continuing shift from an offline to online world has contributed to the growth of our business since inception resulting in increasing revenues and we expect that this online shift will continue to benefit our business
as online advertising evolves we continue to expand our product offerings which may impact our monetization
as interactions between users and advertisers change we continue to expand our product offerings to serve their changing needs over time we expect our monetization trends to fluctuate for example we have seen an increase in youtube engagement ads which monetize at a lower rate than traditional search desktop ads additionally advertisers are beginning to shift to programmatic buying which presents opportunities for advertisers to connect with the right user in the right moment in the right context this may also have different monetization profiles to our existing advertising business these trends will continue to affect our monetization in the future
users are increasingly using multiple devices to access our products and services and our advertising revenues are increasingly coming from mobile phones and other new formats
our users are accessing the internet via multiple devices mobile computing power continues to grow and users want to feel connected no matter where they are or what they are doing we seek to expand our products and services to stay in front of this shift in order to maintain and grow our business
in this multidevice world we generate our advertising revenues increasingly from mobile phones and newer advertising formats and the margins from the advertising revenues from these sources have generally been lower than those from desktop computers and tablets our traffic acquisition cost tac may also be impacted because the rates at which we share mobile revenues with our partners may differ from our traditional desktop and tablet formats we expect both of these trends to continue to put pressure on our overall margins particularly if we fail to realize the opportunities presented during the transition to a dynamic multiscreen environment
as users in developing economies increasingly come online we generate increasing revenues from international markets and movements in foreign exchange rates impact such revenues


table of contents
alphabet inc and google inc

the shift to online as well as the advent of the multidevice world has brought opportunities outside of the us especially in emerging markets and we continue to develop localized versions of our products and relevant advertising programs useful to our users in these markets this has led to a trend of increased revenues from international markets over time and we expect that our results will continue to be impacted by our performance in these markets particularly as lowcost mobile devices become more available
our international revenues represent a significant proportion of our revenues and are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar while we have a foreign exchange risk management program designed to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues and earnings
the portion of our revenues that we derive from nonadvertising revenues is increasing
nonadvertising revenues have grown over time we expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding our google offerings to our users through products like google play cloud and apps and hardware products across these initiatives we currently derive nonadvertising revenues primarily from sales of digital content products hardware sales service and licensing fees the margins on these nonadvertising businesses vary significantly and may be lower than the margins on our advertising business a number of our other bets initiatives are in their initial development stages and as such the sources of revenues from these businesses could change over time and the revenues themselves could be volatile
as we continue to look for new ways to serve our users and expand our businesses we will invest heavily in rd and our capital expenditures will continue to fluctuate
we continue to make significant research and development rd investments in areas of strategic focus for google such as search and advertising as well as in new products and services across both google and other bets the amount of our capital expenditures has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate in the long term as we invest heavily in our systems data centers real estate and facilities and information technology infrastructure
in addition acquisitions remain an important part of our strategy and use of capital and we expect to continue to spend cash on acquisitions and other investments these acquisitions generally enhance the breadth and depth of our offerings as well as expanding our expertise in engineering and other functional areas

our employees are critical to our success and we expect to continue investing in them
our employees are among our best assets and are critical for our continued success their energy and talent drive alphabet and create our success we expect to continue hiring talented employees and to provide competitive compensation programs to our employees as of december   we had  fulltime employees  in research and development  in sales and marketing  in operations and  in general and administrative an increase of  total headcount from december

use of monetization metrics
when assessing our advertising revenue performance we present information regarding the number of paid clicks and costperclick for our google websites and google network members websites management views these as important metrics for understanding our business we periodically review refine and update our methodologies for monitoring gathering and counting the number of paid clicks and for identifying the revenues generated by click activity
paid clicks for our google websites represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by endusers related to searches on googlecom clicks related to advertisements on other owned and operated properties including gmail finance maps and google play and viewed youtube engagement ads like trueview counted as an engagement when the user chooses not to skip the ad paid clicks for our google network members websites include clicks by endusers related to advertisements served on google network members properties participating in our adsense for search adsense for content and admob businesses in some cases such as programmatic and reservation based advertising buying we charge advertisers by impression while growing this represents a small part of our revenue base
costperclick is defined as clickdriven revenue divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the average cost of each engagement by users we charge advertisers
the rate of change in revenue and revenue growth as well as the rate of change in paid clicks and costperclick on google websites and google network members websites and their correlation with the rate of change in revenues has fluctuated and may fluctuate in the future because of various factors including

use of constant currency and constant currency growth
the impact of exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period comparisons our international revenues are favorably impacted as the us dollar weakens relative to other foreign currencies and unfavorably impacted as the us dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies we believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to reported results helps improve the ability to understand our performance because they exclude the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results
constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period we define constant currency revenues as total revenues excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities and use it to determine the constant currency revenue growth on a yearonyear basis constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior period exchange rates as well as excluding any hedging gains realized in the current period
constant currency revenue growth expressed as a percentage is calculated by determining the increase in current period revenues over prior period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior period exchange rates and hedging benefits are excluded from revenues of both periods
these results should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for results reported in accordance with gaap results on a constant currency basis as we present them may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with gaap

the cost of revenues that we incur related to revenues generated from ads placed through our adsense program on the websites of our google network members are significantly higher than the costs of revenues we incur related to revenues generated from ads placed on google websites because most of the advertiser fees from ads served on google network members websites are shared with our google network members for the past five years growth in advertising revenues from google websites has generally exceeded that from our google network members websites this had a positive impact on our income from operations during this period
cost of revenues increased  million from  to  the increase was primarily due to data center costs and an increase in content acquisition costs as a result of increased activities related to youtube and digital content the remaining increase was driven by increases in traffic acquisition costs of  million resulting from more advertiser fees generated through our adsense program driven primarily by an increase in advertising revenues as well as more fees paid to our distribution partners for additional traffic directed to our websites additionally there was an impairment charge of  million recognized in  related to a patent licensing royalty asset acquired in connection with the motorola acquisition that did not recur in  the decrease in aggregate traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues was primarily a result of a shift of mix from google network members websites revenue to google websites revenue
cost of revenues increased  million from  to  the increase was partially due to increases in traffic acquisition costs of  million resulting from more distribution fees paid for additional traffic directed to google websites as well as more advertiser fees paid to google network members driven primarily by an increase in advertising revenues the remaining increase was primarily driven by an increase in data center costs content acquisition costs as a result of increased usage activities related to youtube and digital content by our users and revenue share payments to mobile carriers and original equipment manufacturers oems in addition the increase was also driven by the impairment charge described above the decrease in traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues was primarily a result of a shift of mix between google websites revenue and google network members websites revenue
we expect cost of revenues will increase in dollar amount and fluctuate as a percentage of total revenues in  and future periods based on a number of factors including the following

the relative growth rates of revenues from google websites and from our google network members website

the growth rates of expenses associated with our data center operations as well as our hardware inventory costs

increased proportion of other nonadvertising revenues as part of our total revenues

whether we are able to enter into more revenue share arrangements with google network members and distribution partners that provide for lower revenue share obligations or whether increased competition for arrangements with existing and potential google network members and distribution partners results in less favorable revenue share arrangements

whether we are able to continue to improve the monetization of traffic on google websites and our google network members websites and

the relative growth rates of expenses associated with distribution arrangements and the related revenues generated

other income expense net as a percentage of revenues


 


 

other income expense net decreased  million from  to  this decrease was primarily related to a writedown of securities received in conjunction with the sale of a business as well as reduced gains on nonmarketable investments as compared to  these decreases were partially offset by an increase in interest income as a result of increased cash and fixed income investments
other income expense net increased  million from  to  this increase was primarily driven by realized gains on nonmarketable equity investments of  million and previouslyheld equity interests of  million as well as a loss recognized on divestiture of businesses other than motorola home in  these increases were partially offset by an increase in foreign currency exchange loss of  million and a decrease in interest income of  million
the costs of our foreign exchange hedging activities recognized to other income net are primarily a function of the notional amount of the option and forward contracts and their related duration the movement of the foreign exchange rates relative to the strike prices of the contracts and the volatility of foreign exchange rates
as we expand our international business costs related to hedging activities under our foreign exchange risk management program may increase in  and future periods

critical accounting policies and estimates
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap in doing so we have to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in some cases we could reasonably have used different accounting policies and estimates in some cases changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period accordingly actual results could differ materially from our estimates to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results our financial condition or results of operations will be affected we base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis we refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates which we discuss further below we have reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors
please see note  of part ii item  of this annual report on form k for the summary of significant accounting policies
income taxes
we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes
although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes
loss contingencies
we are regularly subject to claims suits government investigations and other proceedings involving competition and antitrust intellectual property privacy indirect taxes labor and employment commercial disputes content generated by our users goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms and other matters certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages we record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated if we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated we disclose the possible loss in the notes to the consolidated financial statements
we evaluate on a monthly basis developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed and make adjustments and changes to our disclosures as appropriate significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters until the final resolution of such matters there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded and such amounts could be material should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could have a material impact on our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows see note  of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item  of this annual report on form k for additional information regarding contingencies
business combinations
we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill when determining the fair values


table of contents
alphabet inc and google inc

of assets acquired and liabilities assumed management makes significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets
critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer relationships and acquired patents and developed technology and discount rates managements estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates
other estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as more fully discussed in note  of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item  of this annual report on form k
goodwill
goodwill is allocated to reporting units expected to benefit from the business combination we evaluate our reporting units when changes in our operating structure occur and if necessary reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired goodwill impairment tests require judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit as of december   no impairment of goodwill has been identified
longlived assets
longlived assets including property and equipment longterm prepayments and intangible assets excluding goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows generated from the assets are less than their carrying amount measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value
impairment of marketable and nonmarketable securities
we periodically review our marketable and nonmarketable securities for impairment if we conclude that any of these investments are impaired we determine whether such impairment is otherthantemporary factors we consider to make such determination include the duration and severity of the impairment the reason for the decline in value and the potential recovery period and our intent to sell for marketable debt securities we also consider whether  it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis and  the amortized cost basis cannot be recovered as a result of credit losses if any impairment is considered otherthantemporary we will write down the asset to its fair value and record the corresponding charge as other income expense net

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk
we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates
foreign currency exchange risk
we transact business globally in multiple currencies our international revenues as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar we are a net receiver of foreign currencies and therefore benefit from a weakening of the us dollar and are adversely affected by a strengthening of the us dollar relative to the foreign currency as of december   our most significant currency exposures are the british pound euro and japanese yen
we use foreign exchange option contracts to protect our forecasted us dollarequivalent earnings from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates these hedging contracts reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of adverse currency exchange rate movements we designate these option contracts as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes  the fair value of the option contract is separated into its intrinsic and time values changes in the time value are recorded in other income expense net changes in the intrinsic value are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci and subsequently reclassified into revenues to offset the hedged exposures as they occur
we considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that changes in exchange rates of  could be experienced in the near term if the us dollar weakened by  as of december   and december   the amount recorded in aoci reflecting intrinsic value related to our

foreign exchange options before tax effect would have been approximately  million and  million lower as of december   and december   and the total amount of expense recorded as other income expense net would have been approximately  million and  million higher in the years ended december   and december   if the us dollar strengthened by  as of december   and december   the amount recorded in accumulated aoci related to our foreign exchange options before tax effect would have been approximately  billion and  billion higher as of december   and december   and the total amount of expense recorded as other income expense net would have been approximately  million and  million higher in the years ended december   and december   in both scenarios the change in the intrinsic value would be expected to offset a corresponding foreign currency change in forecasted hedged revenues when recognized
in addition we use foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currency of the subsidiary these forward contracts reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities the foreign currency gains and losses on the assets and liabilities are recorded in other income expense net which are offset by the gains and losses on the forward contracts
we considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of  for all currencies could be experienced in the near term these reasonably possible adverse changes in exchange rates of  were applied to total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currencies at the balance sheet dates to compute the adverse impact these changes would have had on our income before income taxes in the near term these changes would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately  million and  million as of december   and december   the adverse impact as of december   and december   is after consideration of the offsetting effect of approximately  million and  billion from foreign exchange contracts in place for the months of december   and december  
interest rate risk
our investment strategy is to achieve a return that will allow us to preserve capital and maintain liquidity requirements we invest primarily in debt securities including those of the us government and its agencies corporate debt securities agency mortgagebacked securities money market and other funds municipal securities time deposits asset backed securities and debt instruments issued by foreign governments by policy we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer our investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall as of december   and december   unrealized losses on our marketable debt securities were primarily due to temporary interest rate fluctuations as a result of higher market interest rates compared to interest rates at the time of purchase we account for both fixed and variable rate securities at fair value with changes on gains and losses recorded in aoci until the securities are sold we use interest rate derivative contracts to hedge gains and losses on our securities these derivative contracts are accounted for as hedges at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other income expense net
we considered the historical volatility of shortterm interest rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that an adverse change of  basis points could be experienced in the near term a hypothetical   basis points increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our marketable securities of approximately  billion and  billion as of december   and december

prior period amounts have been adjusted to reflect the reclassification primarily related to doubleclick ad serving software revenues from google other revenues to advertising revenues from google network members websites to conform with current period presentation
we generate revenues primarily by delivering performance and brand advertising performance advertising creates and delivers relevant ads that users will click leading to direct engagement with advertisers brand advertising enhances users awareness of and affinity with advertisers products and services through videos text images and other ads that run across various devices
google adwords is our auctionbased advertising program that enables performance advertisers to place textbased and display ads on google websites and our google network members websites google adsense refers to the online programs through which we distribute our advertisers adwords ads for display on our google network members websites most of our customers pay us on a costperclick basis which means that an advertiser pays us only when a user engages with the ads by clicking on an ad on google websites or google network members websites or by viewing youtube engagement ads like trueview counted as an engagement when the user chooses not to skip the ad we also offer advertising on a costperimpression basis that enables our brand advertisers to pay us based on the number of times their ads display on google websites and our google network members websites as specified by the advertisers
revenue from advertising is recognized when the services have been provided or delivered the fees we charge are fixed or determinable we and our advertisers or other customers understand the specific nature and terms of the agreed upon transactions and collectability is reasonably assured we recognize as revenues the fees charged to advertisers each time a user clicks on one of the ads that appears next to the search results or content on google websites or our google network members websites for those advertisers using our costperimpression pricing we recognize as revenues the fees charged to advertisers each time their ads are displayed on google websites or our google network members websites we report our google adsense revenues and traffic acquisition costs due to our google network members on a gross basis principally because we are the primary obligor to our advertisers
revenue from hardware sales to end customers or through distribution channels is generally recognized when products have been shipped risk of loss has transferred to the customer objective evidence exists that customer acceptance provisions have been met no significant obligations remain and allowances for discounts price protection returns and customer incentives can be reasonably and reliably estimated revenues are reported net of these allowances where these allowances cannot be reasonably and reliably estimated we recognize revenue at the time the product sells through the distribution channel to the end customer or when the return period elapsed as applicable
for the sale of certain thirdparty products and services we evaluate whether it is appropriate to recognize revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customers or the net amount earned as revenue share generally when we record revenue on a gross basis we are the primary obligor in a transaction and have also considered other factors including whether we are subject to inventory risk or have latitude in establishing prices
for multielement arrangements including those that contain software essential to hardware products functionality and services we allocate revenue to each unit of accounting based on their relative selling prices in such circumstances we use a hierarchy to determine the selling prices to be used for allocating revenue i vendorspecific objective

evidence of fair value vsoe ii thirdparty evidence of selling price and iii best estimate of the selling price esp vsoe generally exists only when we sell the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by us for that deliverable esps reflect our best estimates of what the selling price of the deliverable would be if it was sold regularly on a standalone basis
we record deferred revenues when cash payments are received in advance of our performance in the underlying agreement on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
cost of revenues
cost of revenues consists of traffic acquisition costs which are the advertising revenues shared with our google network members and the amounts paid to our distribution partners who distribute our browser or otherwise direct search queries to our website

the expenses associated with the operation of our data centers including depreciation labor energy and bandwidth costs

content acquisition costs primarily related to payments to certain content providers from whom we license their video and other content for distribution on youtube and google play we share most of the fees these sales generate with content providers or pay a fixed fee to these content providers

credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions

stockbased compensation expense

revenue share payments to mobile carriers

inventory costs for hardware we sell and

amortization of certain intangible assets
stockbased compensation
restricted stock units rsus are measured based on the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant shares are issued on the vesting dates net of the minimum statutory tax withholding to be paid by us on behalf of our employees as a result the actual number of shares issued will be fewer than the actual number of rsus outstanding we record the liability for withholding amounts to be paid by us primarily as a reduction to additional paidin capital when paid
for stock option awards we determined fair value using the blackscholesmerton bsm option pricing model on the date of grant
stockbased compensation includes awards we expect to settle in alphabet stock as well as awards we will ultimately settle in cash we recognize stockbased compensation less an estimate for forfeitures using the straightline method over the requisite service period additionally stockbased compensation for liability classified awards reflect changes in fair value during the requisite service period
we include as part of cash flows from financing activities the benefits of tax deductions in excess of the taxeffected compensation of the related stockbased awards for options exercised and rsus vested during the period during the years ended december    and  the amount of cash received from the exercise of stock options was  million  million and  million respectively
we have elected to account for the indirect effects of stockbased awards  primarily the research and development tax credit  through the consolidated statements of income total direct tax benefit realized including the excess tax benefit from stockbased award activities during the years ended december    and  was  million  million and  million respectively
certain risks and concentrations
our revenues are primarily derived from online advertising the market for which is highly competitive and rapidly changing in addition our revenues are generated from a multitude of vertical market segments in countries around the world significant changes in this industry or changes in customer buying or advertiser spending behavior could adversely affect our operating results
we are subject to concentrations of credit risk principally from cash and cash equivalents marketable securities foreign exchange contracts and accounts receivable cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of time deposits money market and other funds including cash collateral received related to our securities lending program highly liquid debt instruments of the us government and its agencies debt instruments issued by foreign governments and municipalities in the us corporate securities agency mortgagebacked securities and assetbacked securities foreign exchange contracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standing

accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenues earned from customers located around the world in   and  we generated approximately   and  of our revenues from customers based in the us with the majority of revenues from customers outside of the us located in europe and japan we perform ongoing evaluations to determine customer credit and we limit the amount of credit we extend but generally we do not require collateral from our customers we maintain reserves for estimated credit losses and these losses have generally been within our expectations
no individual customer or groups of affiliated customers represented more than  of our revenues in   or 
fair value of financial instruments
our financial assets and financial liabilities that include cash equivalents marketable securities foreign currency and interest rate derivative contracts and nonmarketable debt securities are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis we measure certain financial assets at fair value for disclosure purposes as well as on a nonrecurring basis when they are deemed to be otherthantemporarily impaired our other current financial assets and our other current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying value
fair value is an exit price representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as such fair value is a marketbased measurement that is determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured and classified in accordance with a threetier fair value hierarchy based on the observability of the inputs available in the market used to measure fair value
level   observable inputs that reflect quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets
level   include other inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and modelbased valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be derived from observable market data where applicable these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using marketbased observable inputs including interest rate curves foreign exchange rates and credit ratings
level   unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activities
the fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value
cash cash equivalents and marketable securities
we invest all excess cash primarily in debt securities including those of the us government and its agencies corporate debt securities agency mortgagebacked securities money market and other funds municipal securities time deposits asset backed securities and debt instruments issued by foreign governments
we classify all investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and have stated maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase as cash equivalents and those with stated maturities of greater than three months as marketable securities
we determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date we have classified and accounted for our marketable securities as availableforsale after consideration of our risk versus reward objectives as well as our liquidity requirements we may sell these securities prior to their stated maturities as we view these securities as available to support current operations we classify highly liquid securities with maturities beyond  months as current assets under the caption marketable securities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets we carry these securities at fair value and report the unrealized gains and losses net of taxes as a component of stockholders equity except for unrealized losses determined to be otherthantemporary which we record within other income expense net we determine any realized gains or losses on the sale of marketable securities on a specific identification method and we record such gains and losses as a component of other income expense net
nonmarketable investments
we have accounted for nonmarketable equity investments either under the equity or cost method investments through which we exercise significant influence but do not have control over the investee are accounted for under the equity method investments through which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee are accounted for under the cost method


table of contents
alphabet inc and google inc

we have accounted for our nonmarketable investments that meet the definition of a debt security as availableforsale securities since these securities do not have contractual maturity dates and we do not intend to liquidate them in the next  months we have classified them as noncurrent assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet
variable interest entities
we make a determination at the start of each arrangement whether an entity in which we have made an investment is considered a variable interest entity vie we consolidate vies in which we have a controlling financial interest if we do not have a controlling financial interest in a vie we account for the investment under either the equity or cost method
impairment of marketable and nonmarketable investments
we periodically review our marketable and nonmarketable investments for impairment if we conclude that any of these investments are impaired we determine whether such impairment is otherthantemporary factors we consider to make such determination include the duration and severity of the impairment the reason for the decline in value and the potential recovery period and our intent to sell for debt securities we also consider whether  it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis and  the amortized cost basis cannot be recovered as a result of credit losses if any impairment is considered otherthantemporary we will write down the asset to its fair value and record the corresponding charge as other income expense net
accounts receivable
we record accounts receivable at the invoiced amount and we normally do not charge interest we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible receivables we review the accounts receivable by amounts due by customers which are past due to identify specific customers with known disputes or collectability issues in determining the amount of the reserve we make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations we also maintain a sales allowance to reserve for potential credits issued to customers we determine the amount of the reserve based on historical credits issued
property and equipment
we account for property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization we compute depreciation using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets generally two to five years we depreciate buildings over periods up to  years we amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets construction in progress is the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet been placed in service for our intended use depreciation for equipment commences once it is placed in service and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements commences once they are ready for our intended use land is not depreciated
software development costs
we expense software development costs including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to be marketed to external users before technological feasibility is reached technological feasibility is typically reached shortly before the release of such products and as a result development costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material for the periods presented
software development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and cloud based applications used to deliver our services we capitalize development costs related to these software applications once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended costs capitalized for developing such software applications were not material for the periods presented
business combinations
we include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the respective dates of acquisition we allocate the fair value of the purchase price of our acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill
longlived assets including goodwill and other acquired intangible assets
we review property and equipment longterm prepayments and intangible assets excluding goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be

recoverable we measure recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected to generate if the assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair market value in  we recorded impairments of intangible assets including an impairment of  million in the third quarter of  related to a patent licensing royalty asset impairments of intangible assets were not material in 
we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination we evaluate our reporting units when changes in our operating structure occur and if necessary reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach we test our goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired no goodwill impairment has been identified in any of the years presented
intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives we amortize our acquired intangible assets on a straightline basis with definite lives over periods ranging from one to twelve years
income taxes
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method under which we recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns we measure current and deferred tax assets and liabilities based on provisions of enacted tax law we evaluate the realization of our deferred tax assets based on all available evidence and establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets when it is morelikelythannot that they will not be realized
we recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is morelikelythan not that based on technical merits the position will be sustained upon examination the tax benefits of the position recognized in the financial statements are then measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is greater than  likely to be realized upon settlement with a taxing authority in addition we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the income tax provision
foreign currency
generally the functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the local currency we translate the financial statements of these subsidiaries to us dollars using monthend exchange rates for assets and liabilities and average rates for the annual period derived from monthend exchange rates for revenues costs and expenses we record translation gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of stockholders equity we reflect net foreign exchange transaction gains and losses resulting from the conversion of the transaction currency to functional currency as a component of foreign currency exchange losses in other income expense net
advertising and promotional expenses
we expense advertising and promotional costs in the period in which they are incurred for the years ended december    and  advertising and promotional expenses totaled approximately  million  million and  million

of  on a retrospective basis we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements
in february  the fasb issued accounting standards update no  asu  consolidation topic  amendments to the consolidation analysis asu  changes the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities we will adopt this standard in the first quarter of  on a retrospective basis we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated statement of operations or consolidated balance sheet but it may result in additional disclosures
in november  the fasb issued accounting standards update no  asu  income taxes topic  balance sheet classification of deferred taxes  asu  simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by eliminating the separate classification of deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in the consolidated balance sheet statement of financial position the amendments in the update require that all deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheet the amendments in this update are effective for annual periods beginning after december   and interim periods therein and may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively to all periods presented early adoption is permitted we have early adopted this standard in the fourth quarter of  on a retrospective basis prior periods have been retrospectively adjusted

revision of previously issued financial statements
in the second quarter of  we identified an incorrect classification of certain revenues between legal entities and as a consequence we revised our income tax expense for periods beginning in  through the first quarter of  in the cumulative amount of  million we evaluated the materiality of the income tax expense impact quantitatively and qualitatively and concluded it was not material to any of the prior periods impacted and that correction of income tax expense as an out of period adjustment in the quarter ended june   would not be material to our consolidated financial statements for the year ending december   consolidated revenues are not impacted we elected to revise previously issued consolidated financial statements for the periods impacted refer to note  for additional information
prior period reclassifications
certain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation
note  financial instruments
we classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities within level  or level  in the fair value hierarchy because we use quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs to determine their fair value we classify our foreign currency and interest rate derivative contracts primarily within level  in the fair value hierarchy as the valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and market observable data of similar instruments

derivative financial instruments
we recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at fair value we record changes in the fair value ie gains or losses of the derivatives in the accompanying consolidated statements of income as other income expense net as part of revenues or as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as discussed below
we enter into foreign currency contracts with financial institutions to reduce the risk that our cash flows and earnings will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations we use certain interest rate derivative contracts to hedge interest rate exposures on our fixed income securities and debt our program is not used for trading or speculative purposes
we enter into master netting arrangements which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty to further reduce credit risk we enter into collateral security arrangements under which the counterparty is required to provide collateral when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds we can take possession of the collateral in the event of counterparty default as of december   and  we received cash collateral related to the derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements of  million and  million
cash flow hedges
we use options designated as cash flow hedges to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar the notional principal of these contracts was approximately  billion and  billion as of december   and  these foreign exchange contracts have maturities of  months or less
in  we entered into forwardstarting interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of  billion and terms calling for us to receive interest at a variable rate and to pay interest at a fixed rate that effectively locked in an interest rate on our anticipated debt issuance of  billion in  we issued  billion of unsecured senior notes in february  see details in note  as a result we terminated the forwardstarting interest rate swaps upon the debt issuance the cash gain associated with the termination is reported within operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december   consistent with the impact of the hedged item
we reflect gain or loss on the effective portion of a cash flow hedge as a component of aoci and subsequently reclassify cumulative gains and losses to revenues or interest expense when the hedged transactions are recorded if the hedged transactions become probable of not occurring the corresponding amounts in aoci would be immediately reclassified to other income expense net further we exclude the change in the time value of the options from our

we use interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges to hedge interest rate risk for certain fixed rate securities the notional principal of these contracts was  million and  million as of december   and 
gains and losses on these forward contracts and interest rate swaps are recognized in other income expense net along with the offsetting losses and gains of the related hedged items
other derivatives
other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist of forward and option contracts that we use to hedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currency of a subsidiary we recognize gains and losses on these contracts as well as the related costs in other income expense net along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities the notional principal of foreign exchange contracts outstanding was  billion and  billion as of december   and

the state attorney general from mississippi issued subpoenas in  and  in an antitrust investigation of our business practices we have responded to those subpoenas and we remain willing to cooperate with them if they have any further information requests
patent and intellectual property claims
we have had patent copyright and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products services and technologies infringe the intellectual property rights of others adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages costly royalty or licensing agreements or orders preventing us from offering certain features functionalities products or services and may also cause us to change our business practices and require development of noninfringing products or technologies which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business in addition the us international trade commission itc has increasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss for a company or its suppliers in an itc action could result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the us since the us is an important market a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us including preventing us from importing many important products into the us or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products
furthermore many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement claims against them which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products services and technologies as a result of injunctions or otherwise which could result in loss of revenues and adversely impact our business
other

note  net income per share
alphabet
we compute net income per share of class a and class b common stock and class c capital stock using the twoclass method basic net income per share is computed using the weightedaverage number of common shares outstanding during the period diluted net income per share is computed using the weightedaverage number of common shares and the effect of potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period potentially dilutive securities consist of stock options restricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options restricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method the computation of the diluted net income per share of class a common stock assumes the conversion of class b common stock while the diluted net income per share of class b common stock does not assume the conversion of those shares
the rights including the liquidation and dividend rights of the holders of our class a and class b common stock and class c capital stock are identical except with respect to voting further there are a number of safeguards built into our certificate of incorporation as well as delaware law which preclude our board of directors from declaring or paying unequal per share dividends on our class a and class b common stock and class c capital stock specifically delaware law provides that amendments to our certificate of incorporation which would have the effect of adversely altering the rights powers or preferences of a given class of stock must be approved by the class of stock adversely affected by the proposed amendment in addition our certificate of incorporation provides that before any such amendment may be put to a stockholder vote it must be approved by the unanimous consent of our board of directors as a result the undistributed earnings for each year are allocated based on the contractual participation rights of the class a and class b common shares and class c capital stock as if the earnings for the year had been distributed as the liquidation and dividend rights are identical the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis the net income per share amounts are the same for class a and class b common stock and class c capital stock because the holders of each class are legally entitled to equal per share distributions whether through dividends or in liquidation further as we assume the conversion of class b common stock in the computation of the diluted net income per share of class a common stock the undistributed earnings are equal to net income for that computation
stock split effected in form of stock dividend
in january  our board of directors approved the distribution of shares of class c capital stock as a dividend to our holders of class a and class b common stock the stock split the stock split had a record date of march   and a payment date of april   
in the second quarter of  in accordance with a settlement of litigation involving the authorization to distribute class c capital stock at the close of trading on april   the last trading day of the  day period following the first date the class c shares traded on nasdaq lookback period we determined that a payment the adjustment payment in the amount of  million was due to class c capital stockholders the amount of the adjustment payment was based on the percentage difference that developed between the volumeweighted average price of class a and class c shares during the lookback period as supplied by nasdaq dataondemand and was payable to holders of class c capital stock as of the end of the lookback period in cash class a common stock class c capital stock or a combination thereof at the discretion of our board of directors on april   our board of directors approved the adjustment payment in shares of class c capital stock and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of class c capital stock in may  the adjustment payment was made resulting in the issuance of approximately  thousand shares of class c capital stock with  million reflected in additionalpaid in capital and  million of cash in lieu of fractional shares of class c capital stock
in the year ended december   the adjustment payment was allocated to the numerator for calculating net income per share of class c capital stock from net income available to all stockholders and the remaining undistributed earnings were allocated on a pro rata basis to class a and class b common stock and class c capital stock based on the number of shares used in the per share computation for each class of stock the weightedaverage share impact of the adjustment payment is included in the denominator of both basic and diluted net income per share computations for the year ended december

in the years ended december   and  the net income per share amounts are the same for class a and class b common stock and class c capital stock because the holders of each class are entitled to equal per share dividends or distributions in liquidation in accordance with our amended and restated certificate of incorporation of alphabet inc
the par value per share of our shares of class a and class b common stock remained unchanged at  per share after the stock split on the effective date of the stock split a transfer between retained earnings and common stock occurred in an amount equal to the  par value of the class c capital stock that was issued
share and per share amounts for the prior periods presented below have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split
