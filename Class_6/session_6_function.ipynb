    "# Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, a function is a device that groups a set of statements so they can be run more than once in a program. Functions also can compute a result value and let us specify parameters that serve as function inputs, which may differ each time the function is applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions serve two primary purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Maximizing code reuse and minimizing redundancy*: Functions are the simplest way to package logic you may wish to use in more than one place and more than one time\n",
    "\n",
    "*Procedural decomposition*: Functions also provide a tool for splitting systems into pieces that have well-defined roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, using functions offers the following advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Putting the code in a function makes it a tool that you can run as many times as you like.\n",
    "- When the logic is packaged in a function, you only have to change code in one place of you make a mistake or need to add something.\n",
    "- Callers can pass arbitrary arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## def Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "The def statement creates a function and assigns it a name.  The general form is\n",
    "\n",
    "def name(arg1, arg2, ...):\n",
    "\n",
    "    statement\n",
    "    \n",
    "    return value\n",
    "    \n",
    "The Python return statement can show up anywhere in a function body; it ends the function call and sends a result back.  The return statement is optionall if it's not present, the function exits when the control flow falls off the end of the function body.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simple Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "We will define a function called times that returns the product of two input value x and y.  Order matters here, so the first input will be x and the second will be y in the function."
